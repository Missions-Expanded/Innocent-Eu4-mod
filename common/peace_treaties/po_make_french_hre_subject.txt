# Completely scripted peace treaties are made here

# THIS is the Taker and FROM the Giver in all scopes unless otherwise stated

# This functionality was made to fully support modded subject types. It can probably also be used for other things, but has the following limitations:
# These treaties don't support having a different Taker/Giver than the two countries that are negotiating.
# Nor do they support setting provinces (like cede province) or third party countries (like annull treaties) as targets.

# Example:
po_make_french_hre_subject = {
	# The following strings need localization:
	#		"po_make_french_hre_subject_desc" (uses text processing, supporting bracket notation) ("[FROM.GetName] becomes a [THIS.GetName] Dummy")
	#		"CB_ALLOWED_po_make_french_hre_subject" (uses plain localization) ("Enforced Dumbness")
	#		"PEACE_po_make_french_hre_subject" (uses plain localization, but with support for $TAKER$, $TAKERS$, $GIVER$ and $GIVERS$) ("Become $TAKERS$ Dummy")

	# Values default to 0 or "no" unless otherwise stated

	category = 6 # Any number between 0 and 6. Represents the tab under which it will be listed. 6 corresponds to "treaties". This value currently defaults to 6.
	power_projection = vassalized_rival # "power_projection" will only be applied if giver is your rival.
	power_cost_base = 0.6 # Base factor for diplomatic power cost when treaty is not allowed by casus belli. Scales with war score cost.
