Historically, the Nyingma tradition is unique amongst the schools in that its supporters never held political power, and therefore its practitioners were mostly removed from the political machinations of Tibet, focusing on austerity, celibacy and mysticism.

 me_tibet_chinese_porcellain_title: "Chinese Porcellain"
 me_tibet_chinese_porcellain_desc: "Ah the Porcelain of China. An exquisite material that isn't easily able to be reproduced. Fortunately that means it is also a lucrative trade good.

We cannot and will not deny anybody this right in [Root.GetName]."

 me_tibet_remnants_mongols_desc: "The tribes of the great steppe are powerful and unpredictable. Yet some among them might be convinced to treat us as more than a target for raids and conquests.

Saftey brings stability, stability brings prosperity, and prosperity brings glory. So let us bring more glory to our people."
 me_tibet_end_every_empire_title: "The End of Every Empire"
 me_tibet_end_every_empire_desc: "The vestiges of the original and indigenous Bön faith still hold sway in Tibet, both competing with and merging with the Vajrayana way of Buddhism.

The fierce and inspiring Gods, Elementals, Demons, and Spirits are quite a contrast to the serene Buddha."
