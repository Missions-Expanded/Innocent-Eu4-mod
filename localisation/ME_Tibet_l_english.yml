The building material used for the ab anbar was very hard and widely used: made with a special mortar called a saruj, it was made of sand, clay, egg white, lime, goat hair and ash in specific proportions, depending on the location and climate of the city. This mixture was designed to be completely impervious to water. The walls of the tank were often 2 metres thick, and special bricks were used. These bricks were fired for the ab anbar and were called Ajor ab anbar. Some ab anbars were so large that they could be built under caravanserais like the ab anbar of Hajj Ali Agha in Kerman.

Iranian caravanserais were better built and cleaner than their Turkish counterparts. Caravanserais were designed especially to benefit poorer travelers, as they could stay there for as long as they wished, without payment for lodging. During the reign of Shah Abbas I, as he tried to upgrade the Silk Road to improve the commercial prosperity of the Empire, an abundance of caravanserais, bridges, bazaars and roads were built, and this strategy was followed by wealthy merchants who also profited from the increase in trade. To uphold the standard, another source of revenue was needed, and road toll, that were collected by guards (rah-dars), were stationed along the trading routes."
