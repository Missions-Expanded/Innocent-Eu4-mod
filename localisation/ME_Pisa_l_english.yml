 pis_great_maritime_republic_desc: "The decline of the Maritime Republic began at the end of 1200, in particular with the defeat with Genoa in the Battle of Meloria in 1284. In 1324 it lost Sardinia to the Aragonese and during the 1300s the ruinous attacks on Lucca and Florence unleashed terrible repressions. In 1406 the Florentines led by Gino Capponi conquered the city, thanks to the corruption of the Capitano del Popolo Giovanni Gambacorti, who opened the door of San Marco. With the Florentine occupation begins a period of severe recession for the city and political instability. Through much luck and chance, the Republic of Pisa has resurfaced once more, many people have dreamed of this day, and flock to our court to help us."
