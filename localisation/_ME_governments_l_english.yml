 aztec_society_reform: "Aztec Society"
 aztec_society_reform_desc: "All of Aztec society is built around one thing, the priesthood. In the name of the priests and the gods they serve the aztec wage the flower wars, a war without end, such that there will be an everflowing supply of slaves to sacrfice to empower the gods and stave off doomsday. This reform represents the zealotry embued in every facet of th Aztec administration by the priesthood."
 maya_societ_reform: "Mayan Society"
 maya_societ_reform_desc: "Mayan Society is not what it once was. The Mayan Empire was the greatest the Americas had ever seen, and yet disaster tore it down into the dirt. Now is the time to return to that great age. The collective nostalgia that exists within the Mayan people drives the administration towards a new age. To return to that great state they once were. If only."
 imperial_reform: "Imperial Reforms"
 imperial_reform_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is a thouroughly disorganised and disunited political entity. Administration is incredibly difficult beyond the local level, and the imperial bureaucracy is a sprawling mess. With all of this combined, some oppertunistic nations may be able to covertly divert imperial resources to their own ends, hidden beneath the layers of red tape and countless paper trails of the Empire."
 colonial_reform: "Colonial Outlooks"
 colonial_reform_desc: "The New World is an untapped gold mine of oppertunity. Countless valuable resources are present there, and without the need to compete with other already estalished powers, they are practically begging to be taken for our own. The many layers of administration all agree on this. Taking advantage of this is to great an oppertunity for far too little risk to ignore."
 integration_reform: "Integrated Foreigners"
 integration_reform_desc: "Japan is a bastion of culture. There are some who fear to let foreigners into our land would lessen that beauty. Would dilute our culture and spoil our traditions. But we must embrace foreign help. By integrating these foreigners into our administration, we can use their unique perspectives and understanding to our advantage and surpass what others expect of us."
 isolationist_reform: "Isolationist Policies"
 isolationist_reform_desc: "To allow foreign influences into our nation would be a mistake. To allow them into our administration, the heart of our nations stability, would be even worse. Every administrator and beaurocrat shall be vetted for proper lineage and interviewed extensively to ensure that no foreign influences have indoctrinated their minds. Japan for the Japanese."
 incan_administration_reform: "Incan Administration"
 incan_administration_reform_desc: "The Incan Administration is one of immense power, stemming from it's methods. Spies shall be dispatched to every potential target, and discover everything about them. Their military strength, political organisation and the wealth of their nation shall all be made known to us. A request for submission shall then be dispatched, as well as a small supply of luxury goods. Acceptance shall be met with reward, refusal with military force. The enemy rulers shall be executed and their heirs taken to our capitol, where they shall be tutored in Incan methods, and returned to their old lands, now enlightened to our ways, and submissive to our future requests."
 coptic_religious_reform: "Coptic Faith in Administration"
 coptic_religious_reform_desc: "The Coptic Priesthood is an integral part of our administration, the patriach himself has been granted a permanent position on the council of the realm, granting him extreme amounts of power and influence within it.

 italian_state_reform: "Italian State Policy"
 italian_state_reform_desc: "Italy is a particularly rich region of the world, with many wealthy aristocrats and merchants becoming important members of state, each willing to use their wealth to increase their power and influence, and through that the power of the state."
 zoroastrian_first_reform: "Zoroastrian Society"
 zoroastrian_first_reform_desc: "Zoroastrian Society has changed much since our peak, we have been left as isolated pockets of true believers, left to fend for ourselves in a world that is not kind. Now we have our own state again, a country in which we can practice our religion without fear of persecution. Still, our time sheltering in the lands of others has lead us to be more accepting of others, but also more vicious in the defense of our own."
 zoroastrian_second_reform: "Zoroastrian Methodology"
 zoroastrian_second_reform_desc: "Accepting others is now a fundamental part of our culture and religion. Being accepting of others has given us a considerable boost in the number of converts willing to stand up in defense of our ways, and our acceptance of others, regardless of culture, has lead to our nation being known through the continent."
