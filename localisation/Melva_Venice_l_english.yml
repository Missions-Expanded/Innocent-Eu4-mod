 Melva_Venice_Events.1.T: "The Venetian Fleet"
 Melva_Venice_Events.1.D: "A new phase for the Venetian navy began in 1453, with the fall of Constantinople and the start of the centuries-old confrontation with the Turks. Faced with the growing threat to its maritime possessions, we are faced with the choice of constituting a real permanent naval navy, with dozens of galleys operating in peacetime and an appreciable force of more than one hundred galleys in the event of war."
 Melva_Venice_Events.1.OPT1: "We must create a new mercantile fkeet"
 Melva_Venice_Events.1.OPT2: "Galleys are safer"
 Melva_Venice_Events.1.OPT3: "We can't afford either right now"

 Melva_Venice_Events.2.T: "Magistrato alla Milizia da Mar"
 Melva_Venice_Events.2.D: "The maintenance and administration of such a naval force required an intense organizational effort, which was delegated to a new magistracy in charge of the construction and maintenance of ships and artillery, of the procurement of the biscuit and in general of food, weapons and gunpowder, the recruitment of crews and the supply of money. "
 Melva_Venice_Events.2.OPT1: "Gloria a San Marco!"

 Melva_Venice_Events.3.T: "Naval Reform"
 Melva_Venice_Events.3.D: "At the same time, the spread of firearms gradually led to arming the galleys no longer with traditional Greek fire, but with artillery positioned at the bow and able to fire in the direction of the ship's advance. In the same period, new types of ships were developed: \nThe brig, a small and fast ship, similar to a galley, for escort and transport services. About 20 m long and 3 m wide, for about 14 banks. \nThe galeotta, a small ship similar to a galley, but faster and more maneuverable. About 25 m long and 4 m wide, for about 15 banks. \nThe fusta, a small thin galley. About 35 m long and 5 m wide, for about 20 banks. \nThe bastard galley, with larger dimensions and fuller stern shapes than the thin galley, capable of acting as a captain or patroness, that is, as a flagship."
 Melva_Venice_Events.3.OPT1: "Reforms will come"

 Melva_Venice_Events.4.T: "Governator de' Condannati"
 Melva_Venice_Events.4.D: "In the sixteenth century, the traditional small throwing weapons (bows and crossbows) were gradually replaced on board ships with more modern arquebuses. Also in the same period to the traditional free galleys, whose crews of convicts were composed of the so-called buonavoglia (i.e. free men recruited for pay) and zontaroli (i.e. debtors and convicts, who thus paid off their debt, or conscripts for the need for war), the first sforzate galleys began to join forces, that is, moved exclusively by convicts condemned to forced labor at the oars. The use of this type of ships, however, always remained rather limited in the Venetian navy, so much so that they did not even fall within the normal hierarchy of the fleet and constituted a separate flotilla, dependent on the so-called Governator de 'Condannati."
 Melva_Venice_Events.4.OPT1: "The Commander shall lead them"

 Melva_Venice_Events.5.T: "Porta di Terra"
 Melva_Venice_Events.5.D: "After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and the consequent threat posed by the Ottoman fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, the arsenal underwent important works of war strengthening and productive structures; to commemorate these works, the monumental Porta di Terra (porta da tera) or Porta Magna was erected. The portal, built between 1457 and 1460 on the model of the Roman triumphal arches, became the first example of Renaissance architecture in the city."
 Melva_Venice_Events.5.OPT1: "Marvelous!"

 Melva_Venice_Events.6.T: "Arsenal Expansion"
 Melva_Venice_Events.6.D: "Starting from 1473 and for a century until 1573, the third major phase of development of the arsenal took place, in which the last extensions were made by merging various surrounding marshy lands, with the construction of external residences for workers, public ovens and warehouses for cereals (the Darsena Nuovissima) and galeazze, which led the arsenal to cover an area of almost 24 hectares."
 Melva_Venice_Events.6.OPT1: "Marble, Honour and Virtue"

 Melva_Venice_Events.7.T: "Espansione dell'Arsenale del 1535"
 Melva_Venice_Events.7.D: "through the appropriation of an area owned by the convent of Celestia, at the north-western end of the Arsenale Nuovissimo, placing the activities related to the gunpowder processing and storage; the area was connected to the Arsenale Vecchio, after having acquired other land from the same convent, which brought the already large area dedicated to dust from 5000 to 7800 m² overall. A new facade was erected for the Volto del Bucintoro, expanding the squero to accommodate the ceremonial boat of the same name, rebuilt between 1525 and 1526. Later on was built, close to the walls overlooking the Rio of San Daniele, the artillery workshop - a building about 180 m long, still existing - and the fifteenth-century arms rooms renovated. The close collaboration between artillerymen, smelters and manufacturers of powders, inside and outside the arsenal, contributed to the affirmation of the Venetian war industry, at the forefront in Europe for almost two centuries, with the invention of lethal weapons such as shooting mortars curved, huge siege bombards, culverins, falcons and battle falconets. A decree of the Commission of Ten and the Superintendent of Artillery of 1565 explicitly refers to the presence of "artillery factories" distributed in various warehouses in the arsenal."
 Melva_Venice_Events.7.OPT1: "Marble, Honour and Virtue"

 Melva_Venice_Events.8.T: "Espansione Finale dell'Arsenale"
 Melva_Venice_Events.8.D: "Between 1566 and 1573 the last phase of resumption of the works was carried out in the Arsenale Nuovissimo, with new covered yards in the Isolotto and two large aquatic yards ("water faces") at the reeds or Gaggiandre; between 1566 and 1568 the tezon of sieghe and timber was built facing west, towards the Galeazze canal and next to the Novissimetta, where the Squadratori building is located, overlooking a small basin for the conservation of oak wood. In 1569 there was a powerful explosion of dust in the Celestia area, causing extensive damage to the walls, to some building sites and to the Celestia convent. A fifth extension dates back to the same period, with the excavation of the dock of the galeazze, covered yards for the construction of this new type of battleship, which proved to be decisive for obtaining the victory during the numerous naval battle.\nThe construction of the small temple of the Madonna of the Arsenale leaning against the eastern tower of the Arsenale water gate; later on the architect Antonio da Ponte rebuilt the building of the Corderie; the monumental access portal to the arms rooms and to the artillery workshop that closes the Stradal de Campagna was built."

 Melva_Venice_Events.9.T: "Fanti di Mar"
 Melva_Venice_Events.9.D: "The first example of Fanti da Mar is traced back to the time of the Fourth Crusade when the Doge Enrico Dandolo set up an ordered regiment on ten companies, distributed variously on the ships. This corps participated in the expedition that led to the conquest of Constantinople (1204). Only in 1550, however, these troops found a definitive arrangement and were called Fanti da Mar"

 Melva_Venice_Events.13.T: "Jewish Community"
 Melva_Venice_Events.13.D: "With the battle of Agnadello numerous Jews from the hinterland (there were various communities between Vicenza and Conegliano) poured into the city to escape the abuses of the army of the League of Cambrai. In increasing numbers, they settled in all the Venetian districts, creating not a few frictions with the local population (often fomented by the Friars Minor). \n§YIf we allow them in§! new problems might arise if the other countries show intolerance with them"
 Melva_Venice_Events.13.OPT1: "They are our brothers"
 Melva_Venice_Events.13.OPT2: "Abandon them!"

 Melva_Venice_Events.14.T: "Ghetto Novo"
 Melva_Venice_Events.14.D: "On March 29, 1516 the government of the Serenissima (which would never have admitted an expulsion, given the economic importance of the community) put a hand to this situation by concentrating the Jews in the Ghetto Novo, an islet where a foundry once existed and which then housed a residential neighborhood. The inhabitants were then evicted to allow Jews to be imprisoned in a Ghetto. The only two entrances to the island, the bridges over the Rio di San Girolamo and the Rio del Ghetto, were closed at night and were guarded by Christian guardians, paid by the Jews themselves. \nThe first inhabitants of the Ghetto Nuovo were the Jews of the Tokesca nation (Ashkenazi), which had the obligation to manage pawn shops. The Israelites were allowed few other professions: strazzarìa, or the second-hand trade, and medicine (doctors were allowed to leave the Ghetto at night to visit their patients)."
 Melva_Venice_Events.14.OPT1: "Erect the Ghetto"
 Melva_Venice_Events.14.OPT2: "Execute them"

 Melva_Venice_Events.15.T: "The Levantini Family"
 Melva_Venice_Events.15.D: "In 1541 the Serenissima granted the Ghetto Vecchio (a neighborhood adjacent to the Ghetto Novo) to the Levantini, a group made up of merchants from the Ottoman Empire. The Venetian economy certainly took advantage of this event, troubled by the wars against the Turks and by the increased competition from the port of Ancona. The Levantines had different obligations than the Germans: they did not deal with loans, but were traders. This nation had decidedly particular habits: they exhibited sumptuous and oriental robes, with turbans and ornaments, decidedly contrasting with the modest German Jews."
