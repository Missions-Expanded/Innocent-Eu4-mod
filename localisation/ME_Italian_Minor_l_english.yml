 italian_minor_safe_border_title: "Safe Border"

A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. Once entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and filled with avenues and groves of fruitful trees, watered by stream that flowed from the mountains to a lake."

 italian_minor_rule_italian_trade_desc: "Material riches are necessary; they have instrumental importance, since without them men cannot help and support each other ... But the economic motives are suspect. Being powerful appetites, men fear them, but they are not so mean as to applaud them ... In medieval theory there is no place for an economic activity that is not linked to a moral purpose, and to found a science of society on the postulate that the just of gain is a constant and measurable force, to be accepted, like other natural forces, as an inevitable and evident fact in itself, which would have appeared to the medieval thinker little less irrational and immoral than doing the unlimited exercise of necessary human attributes, such as aggression and the sexual instinct, the premise of social philosophy ...
