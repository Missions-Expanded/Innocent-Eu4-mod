 ME_Bohemia_Event.2.T: "A King for Bohemia"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.2.D: "With the Bohemian throne still up for grabs and undecided, rumors have started emerging around the identity of the new monarch. With the many suitors to the Bohemian throne, three candidates have risen above the rest. The Habsburg candidate whose legitimacy is derived from the late Albrecht II and will most likely persue a more imperialistic agenda, the Jagiellon candidate whose legitimacy is derived from Wladislaw III Jagiellon and will persue a more slavic agenda, and the Podebrad candidate who the populace views as a savior of Bohemia from outside influence and his Hussite ferver will make him pursue a more religious agenda."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.2.OPT1: "A Habsburg ruler would do nicely."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.2.OPT2: "We should go back to our slavic roots."

 ME_Bohemia_Event.7.T: "A Night of Tears"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.7.D: "Eager to avenge the burning of master Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague during the Council of Constance, our troops spared no one as they descended upon the once-great city, Constance. The mission of our generals has always been clear, all churches and memorials for this disgraceful council must be burnt to take revenge on the Catholic world - even only if it's a symbolic revenge. As the time came for the descent of our armies upon the Council City, things turned more hideous than anyone could have immagined. A lifetime of warfare does not foster kindness in anyone and with commanders eager to see the city burn, our troops embarked on a several days long campaign of devastation and plunder of churches, the university, the building of the council as well as the rest of the city. The city burned for more than three days and now the city is no more. Only through joint effort, Jan Hus' last abode was saved, so that future generations of Utraquists and Taborites may experience the last days of master Jan Hus."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.7.OPT1: "A just verdict to an unjust trial."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.7.OPT2: "Show mercy to the people."

 ME_Bohemia_Event.8.D: " 'And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. The devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.' With the recitation of the following verse from the book of revelations, the chastizing of Roma begun. Nobody expected the ransacking and pillaging to be this horrendous, but the desire of vengance overcame the heart of every good Christian on that day. Fearing his life, the pope fled the Vatican city which is now a mere monument of Reformist victory over the Catholic supremacy in the Christian religion."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.8.OPT1: "From the ashes of Catholicism we will build a better Christianity."

 ME_Bohemia_Event.9.T: "A United Front"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.9.D: "The Turkish Ottoman Empire, a major threat to Europe in our time, having just conquered Constantinople and possessing a highly organised military force, is advancing swiftly through the Balkans and threatening both Central Europe and the Mediterranean. To face this menace our most trusted advisors have provided us with an idea. The idea is to create a sort of union of European monarchs. Perhaps the most fascinating component of this proposal is its details which envision the establishment of various organs, such as a European Court which would act as arbiter in the various disputes of Christian monarchs in order to prevent them from entering into conflict and focus instead on uniting all forces to combat the heathen threat to the continent."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.9.OPT1: "Send our diplomats all over the European courts."

 ME_Bohemia_Event.10.T: "A Hope for Salvation"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.10.D: "The Turkish Ottoman Empire, a major threat to Europe in our time, having just conquered Constantinople and possessing a highly organised military force, is advancing swiftly through the Balkans and threatening both Central Europe and the Mediterranean. To face this menace Czech diplomats have approached our court and proposed an idea. The idea is to create a sort of union of European monarchs. Perhaps the most fascinating component of this proposal is its details which envision the establishment of various organs, such as a European Court which would act as arbiter in the various disputes of Christian monarchs in order to prevent them from entering into conflict and focus instead on uniting all forces to combat the heathen threat to the continent."

 ME_Bohemia_Event.10.OPT2: "Deny their offer"

 ME_Bohemia_Event.11.T: "The Bohemian Envoy"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.11.D: "The fated day has come. The Czech Empire and the Ottomans are now at war. Envoys from the Czech Empire have arrived asking from us to provide some form of help to them."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.11.OPT1: "Offer them manpower"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.11.OPT2: "Offer them gold"

 ME_Bohemia_Event.12.T: "Czech Mate"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.12.D: "Milord, our envoy has returned bearing gifts and offerings of encouragement and good will from [From.GetName]. With these offerings by our side, the Ottoman menace will finally face its defeat."

 ME_Bohemia_Event.14.T: "The True Slavic Religion"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.14.D: "With our acquisition of the once mighty Greek states, our dream of a unified Slavic domain seems right at our doorsteps. A domain filled with many different sects of Christianity, a difference that will most probably be the cause of huge religious strifes in the future. Unifying the state's religion should be our first step in accomplish our greater dream of 'Pan - Slavism'"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.14.OPT1: "We will be adherents of the Orthodox Catholic Church."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.14.OPT2: "We will be adherents of the Roman Catholic Church"

 ME_Bohemia_Event.15.T: "The Timber of the Canal"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.15.D: "The border regions of Southern Bohemia that have massive sections of forests which were up to now, un-used, because access to them was not available, the shortage of timber inland, and the price of the timber getting higher has provided us with a rare opportunity. Many of our advisors have suggested the idea of using the Schwarzenberg canal in order to float timber from the Šumava region to warehouses that will ship this timber all over Europe."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.15.OPT1: "Let us invest in the timber industry."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.15.OPT2: "Let us invest in the timber industry."
 ME_Bohemia_Event.15.OPT3: "Timber isn't a very lucrative trade good."

 ME_Bohemia_Event.16.T: "The Second Treaty of Leipzig"
 ME_Bohemia_Event.16.D: "With the Czech control of both Saxonys, our sovereignity has reached an all time low. These new Czech rulers prefer a united Saxony and are spending every diplomatic effort to achieve that preferance. An envoy has just arrived to our court, providing a final term to the negotiations between us and the other Saxony."
