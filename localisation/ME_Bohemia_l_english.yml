The carts were joined wheel to wheel by chains and positioned aslant, with their corners attached to each other, so that horses could be harnessed to them quickly, if necessary. In front of this wall of carts a ditch was dug by camp followers. The crew of each cart consisted of 16-22 soldiers: 4-8 crossbowmen, 2 handgunners, 6-8 soldiers equipped with pikes or flails (the flail was the Hussite signature weapon), 2 shield carriers and 2 drivers. The Hussites' battle consisted of two stages, the first defensive, the second an offensive counterattack. In the first stage the army placed the carts near the enemy army and by means of artillery fire provoked the enemy into battle. The artillery would usually inflict heavy casualties at close range. In order to avoid more losses, the enemy knights finally attacked. Then the infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to ward off the attack, weakening the enemy. The shooters aimed first at the horses, depriving the cavalry of its main advantage. Many of the knights died as their horses were shot and they fell. As soon as the enemy's morale was lowered, the second stage, an offensive counterattack, began. The infantry and the cavalry burst out from behind the carts striking violently at the enemy - mostly from the flanks. While fighting on the flanks and being shot at from the carts the enemy was not able to put up much resistance. They were forced to withdraw, leaving behind dismounted knights in heavy armor who were unable to escape the battlefield. The enemy armies suffered heavy losses and the Hussites soon had the reputation of not taking captives."

 string_start_title_bohemia: "The Interregnum In Bohemia"
 string_start_bohemia: "With the young  §YLadislaus the Posthumous§! being only 5 years old and the small civil wars in the realm, Bohemia is in a dangerous situation.\n\n\n Although religious freedom is secured in Bohemia, many radical hussites want a ruler of their religion. The Habsurgs in Austria think of you as a mere puppet, and will claim your throne when the time comes. Furthermore, Hungary seeks to claim your land as well, with §YJanos Hunyadi§! appointed regent of Hungary in the diet of Pest.\n\n\n Everything is not lost though, The hussites may be your greatest ally. Their will to fight hasn't changed since the hussite wars of 1419–1436. Their tactic of using wagons has proved to be effective, as well as their muskets and crossbows. Great leaders were born thanks to it. The Catholic world may not approve of it, but it has been proven that there is no way to defeat a follower of §YJan Hus§! in battle.\n\n\n Bohemia is a slavic nation, so its ambitions are to unite the slavic world under a greater nation. Poland will be your first and most logical target, since they have a big border with you. After defeating those traitors, ruthenia is the next to follow. And then, Russia itself. For a nation our size this may be hard to do, but courage and great leadership will make short work of any obstacle.\n\n\n Another path for your realm is retaking the Imperial Throne. Not long ago the Bohemians were ruling as superiors in the Empire. Time has passed by, and rules have changed though."
