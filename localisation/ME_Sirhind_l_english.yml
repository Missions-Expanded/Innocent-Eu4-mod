 ### MISSIONS ###
 
 srh_promote_mil_advisor_title: "Promote a Diwan-i-Ariz"
 srh_promote_mil_advisor_desc: "[Root.GetName]'s collapse has caused a great deal of chaos in our administration, with both our army and government left vacant and unorganised. Balban may have strengthened the central core of the military, but this is nothing without someone to fill the position."
 srh_disenfranchise_slaves_title: "Disenfranchise the Slaves"
 srh_disenfranchise_slaves_desc: "Balban began a tradition of favouring nobles and Indians over the influential Turkic slave soldiers, as their power threatened the Sultans tenable position. It is important that the power of these slaves are limited, to prevent any threat of coup, like in Bengal, or a return to the previous Mamluk Sultanate."
 srh_balban_reforms_title: "Continuing the Reforms"
 srh_balban_reforms_desc: "The beginning of the Alai era, after the collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate, saw [Root.GetName]'s army move away from traditional slave soldiery and Turkic warriors, to Khasah-khail, or Special Infantry. Balban also ordered the separation of the military department from the Diwan-i–Wizarai, and placed the military department under a the Diwan-i-Ariz. These reforms helped strengthen [Root.GetName]'s military, promoting individual excellence rather than standardised training, ensuring that each soldier trained competitively and to their limit."
 srh_issue_land_title: "Issuing Land Grants"
 srh_issue_land_desc: "Land is distributed through 3 methods. Iqta land is given as a subsidiary instead of outright payment for officials, as thanks for their services. Khalisa land is the Sultan's own, and the revenue generated is used to fund the royal household. Finally, Inam land is for religious officials to appease the clergy. In order to prevent disaster once again, we must find a balance between patronage and preventing puppet status."
 srh_textile_innovations_title: "Textile Innovations"
 srh_textile_innovations_desc: "Thousands of weavers are employed in Kharkanas, where yards upon yards of robes, silks and cottons would be weaved and produced. In order to prevent any shortages in the future, we must ensure, as early adopters of the water wheel and the worm gear roller, that our monopoly on textiles does not falter"
 srh_heavy_regulations_title: "Regulating Trade"
 srh_heavy_regulations_desc: "While the reforms of Alauddin Khalji have been heavily criticised, being seen as burdensome and controlling, they have prevented price fluctuations and severe grain shortages in times of turmoil and disaster. However, it wouldn't hurt to open up some of these restrictions, as it has become clear that trade is becoming the dominant source of income. We must still keep a close eye, before our riches spiral into the hands of others."
 srh_artillery_title: "Proliferating Falconets"
 srh_artillery_desc: "The change in modern warfare has placed focus on Gunpowder and guns. We must acquire these weapons if we are to stand the test of time, and to further our conquests. While our military will never truly embrace these new weapons, we can ornament our military with small siege weapons to enhance our siege potential."
 srh_tamil_spices_title: "Tamil Trade Guilds"
 srh_tamil_spices_desc: "The newly acquired territories along the Coromandel Coast is home to an autonomous community of traders, the Tamil Kings. These merchants hold great control over the spice trade, with exports from Malaya and Southern India into Arabia and beyond. Their autonomy is annoying, yet any collapse of the network they have established could potentially cause chaos in the trading world. It is important that their independence is mildly recognised, provided that they pledge allegiance to the Sultan, and adhere to some social policies."
 srh_elephant_warfare_title: "Elephant Warfare"
 srh_elephant_warfare_desc: "The forces were commanded by the Sultans as they were the chief lawgiver and the final of the court of appeal. Amirs, Khans, and Maliks were the titles of the military gradation. Men from different nations were enlisted in the army. The army was divided into infantry, cavalry, and elephant corps, with elephants being seen as worth 500 horsemen. They are large and hardy, and have helped us conquer swaths of India. We must continue the long-standing tradition of Elephant warfare."
 srh_qazis_title: "A New Qazi-ul-Qazat"
 srh_qazis_desc: "The Qazi-ul-Qazat was the chief of the Justice Department. He was assisted in this task by several Qazis and Kotwals who helped him in keeping law and order in the country and in the administration of justice. There is an issue with this, as several Ulema happen to also be Qazis, in which they have shown disdain for our Hindu subjects, and often misinterpret Quranic law to further their own needs. The only power is the sultan, so it would be wise to appoint someone who works for the state, not the church."
 srh_city_of_taj_title: "The City of the Taj"
 srh_city_of_taj_desc: "A city lies on the banks of the Yamuna, dating back to the legends of Krishna and Mahabharata. While not nearly as grand as [Root.GetName] once was, it is in a prime position in the centre of the Doab to grow, with local bazars and entrepots already established. With some effort, the city could become a principle administrative centre, and the heart of [Root.GetName]'s resurgence"
 srh_claiming_india_title: "Lay Claim on India"
 srh_claiming_india_desc: "Much of Northern India is still in tumultuous ruin, with various states destroying each other over and over again. In order to achieve our dreams of a unified India, we must have the army for it. We once fielded an army three Lakh big, waged wars with the Mongols, defied any Chinese attempts to breach the Himalayas. Nothing should stop us."
 srh_diamond_delhi_title: "A Diamond in the Rough"
 srh_diamond_delhi_desc: "[Root.GetName]'s history has been tumultuous and destructive. Massive population loss and general ruin has brought the city to the brink of death numerous times. However, the oldest city in India has stayed strong, and the city is once again flourishing under renewed leadership. Surrounded by warfare, It has remained bejewelled and dazzling; a diamond in the rough"
 srh_bengali_jamdani_title: "Bengali Jamdani"
 srh_bengali_jamdani_desc: "While it is upsetting that Bengal has flourished without our administration, The previous Sultans have indeed left us a territory with great potential. The city of Dhaka is one example, with thousands of weavers producing the most beautiful works of fabric ever seen by the Sultan."
 srh_utilise_shipbuilding_title: "Utilise Local Shipbuilding"
 srh_utilise_shipbuilding_desc: "Unlike many Indian Sultanates, [Root.GetName] never had a seafaring tradition. This is why it is important to utilise what our fragments have created. Bengal will be the centre of shipbuilding, having a strong riverine tradition, and merchant links with much of south Asia. We can appoint the old Chief of admiralty to help speed up production"
 srh_malabar_coast_title: "The Konkan Coast"
 srh_malabar_coast_desc: "The Konkan coast is home to the Konkan ports, and have ties to Arabia, where steeds and cavalry are imported. The ports here are of vital importance for any aspiring Indian Ocean Empire, and thus we must sieze it for ourselves."
 srh_furthest_reach_title: "Our Furthest Reach"
 srh_furthest_reach_desc: "The 14th century saw us lose many of our southern posessions. We bordered the tip of the Indian-Subcontinent, traded with the Arabs and Chinese, and our influence extended beyond the oceans. With our massive army marching into the old Hindu lands of Vijayanagara, we can finally reclaim the provinces that were so ruthlessly stolen from us."
 srh_tamil_rule_title: "The Tamils Cannot Run"
 srh_tamil_rule_desc: "The Tamil Kings generally enjoyed autonomy, no matter who ruled them. Even in the days of Chandragupta or Rajendra, no-one could upend them. After our rapid conquests, they were quick to rally to any leader who was not a Muslim, placing Bukka and Harijara as their leaders. Yet they were even quicker to elicit major autonomy from royal affairs. No more! Their entitlement has run out of steam."
 srh_dominate_gulf_title: "Dominating the Gulf"
 srh_dominate_gulf_desc: "The West Coast of India bustles with arabian trade. Horses, Spices and Rice flow multidirectionally across the ocean. Our control over the west face of India has preseneted us with an oppurtunity to utilise our position. That being said, we might need a few more ships."
 srh_let_fires_burn_title: "Let the Fires Burn!"
 srh_let_fires_burn_desc: "[Root.GetName] is no stranger to destruction, and it seems that fate has a way with irony. Our past is filled with plunder, mutual destruction and terror. It just doesn't help that the riches brought home enrich our nation in such a way that we cannot resist it. "
 srh_seize_doab_title: "Seizing the Doab"
 srh_seize_doab_desc: "The Doab runs parallel to the Ganges, the heart of northern India, and thus holds great strategic potential. Once beholden to us, the Sharqi governors betrayed the old Tughluq dynasty and the current Sayyid dynasty, siezing the area as part of the Jaunpuri sultanate. This abomination must end if we are to continue our survival."
 srh_traitors_no_more_title: "Traitors No More"
 srh_traitors_no_more_desc: "Establishing themselves in 1394, controlling Jaunpur, the Sharqis have long coveted our throne, but with our strength renewed, we finally can reclaim the behemoth that lies across the Ganges. They are still adept governors however, meaning that it would be useful to employ them as part of our local administration, easing the transition. We could employ them as Subadars, provincial administrators responsible for suppressing internal revolts, maintaining order and collecting revenue. They would also have full control over the provincial army, ensuring that our army is well garrisoned and managed."
 srh_reintegrate_empire_title: "Re-Integrating the Empire"
 srh_reintegrate_empire_desc: "Tamerlane must've been chuffed to hear that [Root.GetName] began collapsing after his invasion. Well he must be rolling in his grave right now. With the capture of Jaunpur, and the collapse of the Rajputs, we can finally quell our collapse and reclaim all of Hindustan!"
 srh_quell_tiger_title: "Quell the Tiger's Roars"
 srh_quell_tiger_desc: "In a disastrous defeat, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shahi declared Bengali independence, a state that has been nothing but trouble ever since. While much of their conquests were quickly returned to us, it is still worrying that their influence may dominate us both economically and militarily. Bengal is too important to be ignored; we must take it back!"
 srh_subjugate_gajapats_title: "Subjugating the Gajapatis"
 srh_subjugate_gajapats_desc: "The Kingdom of Orissa and its inland subjects act as nothing but a fuel for a growing flame. Their intellectual prowess gives them the ability to stir conflict by supporting any aspiring Raja or Noble. Once we have taken the area, however, their Vedic literature may come useful, as understanding our Brahmin Subjects mya help us ease tensions."
 srh_conquer_malwa_title: "Restoring Malvi Order"
 srh_conquer_malwa_desc: "We may have had better than average relations with the Malwa Sultanate, but their betrayal stills leaves a sore spot. After we have consolidated the Garjats and Rajputana, they are unfortunately in our way towards the deccan."
 srh_revenge_bahmanis_title: "Bahmanid Revenge"
 srh_revenge_bahmanis_desc: "The root of all our problems. It was unbeknownst to the founders of [Root.GetName] that a Chisti Muslim of all people would trigger the downfall of [Root.GetName]. The loss of the Bahmanis triggered a downfall that we have only recently reversed. The traitorous Bahmanids stand as a testament of heresy and treason, something that can be mediated violently "
 srh_daulatabad_title: "Returning to Daulatabad"
 srh_daulatabad_desc: "In 1328, Muhammed bin Tughluq transferred the capital of his kingdom to Devagiri, and renamed it Daulatabad. The sultan made Daulatabad his second capital in 1327. The idea behind transferring the capital was rational, because it lay more or less in the centre of the kingdom, and geographically secured the capital from the north-west frontier attacks. In the Daulatabad fort, he found the area arid & dry. Hence he built a huge reservoir for water storage & connected it with a far-away river. He used siphon system to fill up the reservoir. However, his capital-shift strategy failed miserably. With our renewed control, we can once again attempt to create a new capital in the area."
 srh_wootz_steel_title: "Wootz Steel"
 srh_wootz_steel_desc: "Uchu Kabbina, or commonly mistranslated as Wootz Steel, is one of the most durable metals in Southern India. It is often traded as goods, gifts and weapons. This "Superior Steel" has had stifled production due to our rapid and disorganising conquests. it would be wise to stimulate local foundries, in order to show the world our prestige."
 srh_hindustan_title: "Uniting Hindustan"
 srh_hindustan_desc: "We were once the largest empire the world had ever seen. We braved the Mongols and the Timurids, and ourselves. Now it is time to unite Hindustan once and for all, A home of riches, diversity and strength; in adversity."
 srh_weather_future_title: "Weathering the Future"
 srh_weather_future_desc: "Tamerlane's sack left us in despair. Our empire has crumbled, thousands lay dead in the aftermath. [Root.GetName], the once glorious city is left as but a shadow of its prosperity, and our many breakaway states eye the throne hungrily, eager to reclaim what we have lost. But no more, for [Root.GetName] shall rise again, even if it will be gruelling and destructive."
 srh_deal_with_splinters_title: "Dealing With the Splinters"
 srh_deal_with_splinters_desc: "Our rapid collapse allowed many warlords and governors to scatter into splinter states, that lie where we once conquered. Jaunpur, Bengal and Sirhind - the latter of which we retain nominal control - are eyeing up the fractured territories, causing chaos in the region. Chaos, that can be exploited"
 srh_weather_future_desc: "Tamerlane's sack left us in despair. Our empire has crumbled, thousands lay dead in the aftermath. [Root.GetName], the once glorious city is left as but a shadow of its prosperity, and our many breakaway states eye the throne hungrily, eager to reclaim what we have lost. But no more, for [Root.GetName] shall rise again, even if it will be gruelling and destructive."
 srh_deal_with_splinters_title: "Dealing With the Splinters"
 srh_deal_with_splinters_desc: "Our rapid collapse allowed many warlords and governors to scatter into splinter states, that lie where we once conquered. Jaunpur, Bengal and Sirhind - the latter of which we retain nominal control - are eyeing up the fractured territories, causing chaos in the region. Chaos, that can be exploited"
 srh_loyal_rajputs_title: "The Loyal Rajputs"
 srh_loyal_rajputs_desc: "Jangladesh and the local Rajput clans have remained loyal towards [Root.GetName] since Timurs plunder. They appear to be the most willing of our vassals to rejoin the empire, something that can be hastened, if we "patronise" their loyalty further."
 srh_descend_into_rajputana_title: "Descending into Rajputana"
 srh_descend_into_rajputana_desc: "Many Rajput clans appear to be distasteful towards our renewed leadership. They consistently deny our leadership, and talks of unification can potentially rid any chance sultanate rule in Rajputana. This cannot be allowed, as Rajputana holds lands that may be vital for us, especially when reaching for the traitorous Bahaminis."
 srh_follow_indus_title: "Following the Indus"
 srh_follow_indus_desc: "The Sind Sultanate continues to reject our subjugation. This wouldn't be too much of an issue, but the Sultanates control over the Indus river has the potential to strangle the city of Multan. Since we now have a launch pad down the river, it would be wise to secure our economic hegemony."
 srh_returning_gujarat_title: "Returning to Gujarat"
 srh_returning_gujarat_desc: "The Gujarati Sultans hold immense riches and power over the Arabian gulf, with links to both the Horse and Cloth trade. It's no wonder that the Europeans sailed around a continent just to retain access to these markets. In the past, their independence was met with plunder, yet we could never retain control for the populace did not want it. With promises of greater mercantile freedom, we may be met with slightly less resistance"
 srh_reinvigorate_ties_title: "Reinvigorating Arabian Ties"
 srh_reinvigorate_ties_desc: "Arabia is home to many horses that have been used in conquests for centuries. [Root.GetName] utilised them in our rapid conquests of India, and innovated in the art of cavalry warfare. However, the encroaching Europeans and Ottomans seek to control the Indian Ocean for themselves, causing the already fragile maritime silk road to become even more spontaneously chaotic. In order to continue this supply of horses, we can descend onto Africa, under the guise of protecting our merchants, and land a foothold on the horn."
 srh_balance_of_trade_title: "Favourable Trade Balance"
 srh_balance_of_trade_desc: "[Root.GetName] has always had greater exports than imports, resulting in a favourable balance of trade. This is changing, however, due to the growth of manufacturing outside of India. As a result, we must ensure that our monopolistic attitude remains firm, and in reality."
 srh_malvi_architecture_title: "Malvi Architecture"
 srh_malvi_architecture_desc: "Malwa, while unruly, appeared to have used their time effectively, resulting in many great works of art and architecture. While it is custom to destroy and pillage, there is something about the place that stifles the Sultan, for he has become infatuated with Mandu, the Capital. The Jahaz Mahal, Rani Ruptami Pavilion and the Delhi Darwaza still stand after the conquest, and it is imperative to preserver these monuments."
 srh_suzerain_deccan_title: "Suzerain of the Deccan"
 srh_suzerain_deccan_desc: "It is time to finally rid ourselves of the traitouris Bahmanids. Their fertile plateaus and doabs are prime locations for expansion. It is here where we can expand the influence of the crown, by enacting new land decrees for revenue and construction. We do not want another noble seizing power for themselves"
 srh_diamond_city_title: "A City of Diamonds"
 srh_diamond_city_desc: "Golconda produces much of the worlds diamonds, but has another purpose too. Not only are gems mined, but also pearls and an influx of many precious metals flow through the Raichur Doab from the Arabian and Indian Oceans. It was here when Alauddin Khalji crowned himself with the Koh-i-Noor diamond, a symbol of power and absolutism. It is here where the minting of coins can flourish. A nearby town by the name of Hyderabad has been growing, due to the importance of a standardised place for exchange. Bazzars and Kharkhanas can be built here to enhance the growing needs of the Populace."
 srh_prevent_collapse_title: "Preventing Collapse"
 srh_prevent_collapse_desc: "The 14th century saw territory after territory lost, sack after sack of Delhi, and in the face of imminent destruction, we persevered. The last step in securing our position in the world is to ensure that no power-hungry noble coerces any region te rebel. Subadars must me loyal and capable, subservient to the Sultan and the people. All we need is the aparatus to do so."
 srh_repell_lodis_title: "Repelling the Lodis"
 srh_repell_lodis_desc: "Across the Indus lies Bahlul Lodi, an Afghan warlord who has declared nominal fealty towards us, and yet acts on his own accordance and threatens the Sultan's position. The rebellious state of Sirhind appears to be making plans to seize the Sayyid throne, and Bahlul may only ignite an exposed gunpowder barrel. It would be wise to prevent this"
 srh_assert_control_title: "Asserting Control Again"
 srh_assert_control_desc: "The time has come to end our fractured domain, and assert full crown control over our vassals. Our strength has grown, and it is time to reclaim all of our lands. It will be tough, so we must tread carefully, but in time, we will be victorious"
 srh_encroach_kabul_title: "Encroaching on Kabul"
 srh_encroach_kabul_desc: "Kabul and the Timurid princes that lie beyond the Indus lie safe and sound, knowing that an Indian Sultanate has yet to breach the mountains surrounding the Khyber Pass. It is important that we seize the defensive Hindu Kush mountains while the Timurid princes continue to squabble, lest a new Mongol power arises and threatens all of India "
 srh_afghan_buffer_title: "An Afghan Buffer"
 srh_afghan_buffer_desc: "Now we have reached the Hindu Kush, we can finally begin enacting revenge on the dastardly Timurids. First, the afghans lie in our way. While they have been a source of suffering for centuries, many of our nobility have Afghan heritage, including some of our previous sultans. It would be wise to seek out their expertise before striking the heartlands of the Timurids"
 srh_tamerlane_commeupance_title: "Tamerlane's Comeuppance"
 srh_tamerlane_commeupance_desc: "Much of Samarkand's glory comes from the plunder of Delhi, the looting of many, and the slaughter of thousands. Now the Tiger is dead, and the squabbling Timurids can no longer project power like they used to. With our army on the gates of Samarkand, we shall plunder and destroy, let them know our wrath. Hell hath no fury like a Sultan scorned"
 srh_secure_cavalry_title: "Securing Cavalry"
 srh_secure_cavalry_desc: "While it is useful to have strong trade links, trade is still expensive and waterways are fragile. The Arabian penisula, while rife with horses, is too competitive for the Sultan. Instead, he looks towards East Africa. With and already established merchant community and stables, it appears as if our military is invited in"
 srh_grow_diaspora_title: "Growing the Diaspora"
 srh_grow_diaspora_desc: "The Merchants of Gujarat saw no trouble in our conquests, and it is still a common sight to see indian traders of the Swahili Coast. The trade there is fertile, and we have the oppuritunity to invite some of our people to settle in the areas."
 srh_cannon_foundries_title: "Berari Artillery"
 srh_cannon_foundries_desc: "Warfare has evolved from typical line charges and sword battles, to long and drawn out gunpowder battles. We require a place where our cannons can be manufactured. The Bright minds of the Deccan have already constructed a place in Illchipur, and it would be wise to seize production for ourselves"
 srh_sarf_e_khars_title: "Integrating the Sarf-e-Khas"
 srh_sarf_e_khars_desc: "The Bahmanis, traitorous as they may be, did instate a large and complex form of administration, allowing for cheap and grand recruitment. With a little shuffling around, we too can benefit from the system of Sarf-e-Khas"
 srh_construct_lodi_gardens_title: "Constructing Gardens"
 srh_construct_lodi_gardens_desc: "In order to honour our previous rulers and our capitals grandeur, we must commission a great garden in Delhi, one that holds all of our previous sultans. The mosque should be large and seen for miles, while the grass must be greener than the finest in the Nile. Delhi has been and will continue to be the most gorgeous city ever seen"
 srh_sanskrit_patrons_title: "Sankritic Patronage"
 srh_sanskrit_patrons_desc: "The [Root.Dynasty.GetName]'s are great patronisers of literature. Their work in poetry has made made the renowned in sanskritic circles, as well as the works of "Gulruk", a pen-name of the Sultan. The ordering of translation to Persian also indicates a key interest into the works of the Dharmic people."
 srh_early_absolutism_title: "Early Absolutism"
 srh_early_absolutism_desc: "The Sultan is hungry for power, seeing the past as a reason to not share power. While his impulses make him rowdy to those around him, his administrative reforms have lead to the reducing of power from the Clergy and the Nobility. This can be seen as an early from of Absolute Rule."
 srh_conclude_transition_title: "Concluding the Transition"
 srh_conclude_transition_desc: "The transition from the status of a warlord to a Sultan is not easy, and many nobles are weary of our presence, due to the violence and foreignness of the Sultan. We must pursue a smoother transition, integrating the various branches of the previous Sultans in order to be received well"
 srh_we_are_delhi_title: "We Are Delhi"
 srh_we_are_delhi_desc: "From the fringes of the Hindu Kush, we have been a warlord state, a subject, and now arethe Sultans of the Peacock. It is necessary to be seen as legitimate, let India know that we hold the crown!"
