 ###MISSIONS###
 jnp_zamindar_recruitment_title: "Zamindar Recruitment"
 jnp_zamindar_recruitment_desc: "Due to a predominantly agrarian economy, Jaunpur's population is massive, allowing us to recruits innumerable amounts of peasants. Large amounts of zamindars have followed the Sultan on many campaigns. The Baghela Rajputs of Bhata in Rewa, Bachgoti Rajputs of Sultanpur and Rudauli parganas in Uttar Pardesh, Tomar Rajputs of Gwalior, as well as the Ujjainiya Rajputs of Bhojpur, Bihar, all owed fealty to the Sultan's army, numbering up to 2 Million peasant war bands. Many of the peasants became known as Baksariyas, becoming mercenaries around the Awadh and Bhojpur."
 jnp_create_topkhanas_title: "The Creation of Topkhanas"
 jnp_create_topkhanas_desc: "The coming wars with Delhi has shown the Sultan that the army is no match for the development of gunpowder. Luckily, our large community of zamindars allow us to raise ungodly amounts of men. We shall call on them to deliver us masses of primitive artillery, Topkhanas."
 jnp_varanasi_metals_title: "Varanasi Mettalurgy"
 jnp_varanasi_metals_desc: "The Holy city of Varanasi receives many pilgrims and travellers, which requires a large system of accommodation and leisure facilities to facilitate the travellers. This has spurred the growth of the manufacture of brass and copper idols, lamps, and sacrificial utensils, and all sorts of native cooking and drinking vessels, filling the brass bazaars. Our zamindars however see the potential in shifting the means of production to a more practical sense. The production of Artillery can be utilised, here, although this may upset the Hindus."
 jnp_ties_to_east_west_title: "Ties to East and West"
 jnp_ties_to_east_west_desc: "Jaunpur's diplomatic situation has proven capable, albeit strained. The recent war against Bengal saw us back down after gifts from both the Timurids and Ming. As a testemant to our strength, it is clear that many states fear the might of Jaunpur, yet the diplomatic situation of India proves that we must be crafty with alliances and enemies."
 jnp_bahri_and_tatari_title: "Bahri and Tatari"
 jnp_bahri_and_tatari_desc: "A Large amount of the horses that come into India come from persia, which has tenuous links to the sea. As a result, much of the horses come through the Ganges, which we lie  completely on, giving us a monopoly on the trade. As a result, we can reward many of our 'close' friends with the cavalry they desire, provided that they pledge their loyalty."
 jnp_uniting_the_clans_title: "Uniting the Clans"
 jnp_uniting_the_clans_desc: "Ever since the fall of Kannauj, the city has become ever more populated with Rajput immigrants, hoping to escape the wars and to revel in the imperial glory of the past. Both the Purbiyas, and their more Cavalry oriented brothers out west yearn for a home, one that emphasises their past culture. The posession of Kannauj, or Qannauj, makes it easier to gain favour with the clans, and even possibly seek dominion over all of Rajputana."
 jnp_learning_title: "Dar-ul 'Ilm"
 jnp_learning_desc: "Many Foreigners view Jaunpur as an 'Abode of Learning'. This merit comes from the Sharqis endowment of scholasticism. The works of Shaikh Shabab-ud Din Daulatabadi and Shaik Qutban were all courtiers of Jaunpur. It is only fair that this description becomes actual policy, attracting Muslim and Hindu scholars from across India."
 jnp_peace_title: "Dar-u'l-Aman"
 jnp_peace_desc: "Timur's invasion and subsequent sack of the city of Delhi put into perspective Jaunpur's rise geopolitically speaking. Many great men, polymaths and artists flocked to the city of Jaunpur, giving it the name 'The Abode of Peace'. Treatises, music and Mosques were created here, such as the Chahar Angul Masjid. "
 jnp_bliss_title: "Dar-us Surūr"
 jnp_bliss_desc: "Malik Sarwar did not get enough time for art and architecture. He is said to have built a royal palace on the ruins of Yagi Mandal, one of the buildings of Raja Vijaya Chandra and named it Badi Manzil, while also repairing the Jaunpur Qila. All of this preceded the Renaming of the city to 'The Abode of Bliss'."
 jnp_flush_out_rajputs_title: "Flushing Out the Rajputs"
 jnp_flush_out_rajputs_desc: "The Purbiyas and different Rajput clans are useful from time to time, but the ruckus they make does nothing but cause tension with the local Avadhis and Biharis. It is still our responsibility to make sure our borders, both internally and externally, are secure, so we must flush out the loudest of the troubkemakers."
 jnp_paper_title: "In Need of Paper"
 jnp_paper_desc: "Jaunpur's importance as a centre of arts and science has created a shortage of parchment and paper, required by the scholars of Shiraz-i Hind. We are lucky that the Sharqi's pushed forward paper production in their early reign. Places such as Bihar Sharif and Zafrabad all contain communities of paper-makers. In particular, the long standing paper of Bihar Sharif has been growing recently. Combining the efforts of the Bihari state"
 jnp_abodes_title: "The 3 Abodes"
 jnp_abodes_desc: "Jaunpur is very well known as a seat of learning and culture. Several educational centres and madrasas have been founded at several places in the kingdom of Jaunpur. Scholars and Sufis from far and wide including Persia and Syria visit Jaunpur. Some prominent Sufi saints of Jaunpur were Khwaja Abul Fath, Shaikh ‘Isa Taj, Shaikh Shams-ul Huque Bari Haqqani, Shaikh Baha-ud Din, Shaikh Adhan, Shaikh Farid, Shaikh Husam-ud Din Manikpuri, Shaikh Raji Hamid Shah, Makhdum Asad-ud Din Aftab-i Hind, Makhdum Sadr-ud Din Chiragh-i Hind, Makhdum Qeyam-ud Din, Makhdum Rukn-ud Din, and Sayyid Muhammad Jaunpuri among many others. The Sharqi sultans always respected them and sought their blessings."
 jnp_carpets_title: "Diverse Carpetry"
 jnp_carpets_desc: "The Route of the Sadak-e-Azam carries goods across the Ganges, be it Textiles, Glassware, Rice, or Carpetry. It is in Jaunpur and Bhadohi where carpets are fashioned. Various Persian styles of carpets such as Armenian, Tabrez, Bukhara and Shiraz are manufactured there along with Indian styles of carpets, also called durry, being fashioned here as well. The area is home to thousands of weavers, with some calling Bhadohi 'The Carpet City'"
 jnp_architecture_title: "The Sharqi Style "
 jnp_architecture_desc: "As the Mālik-us-Śarq, we are constantly bombarded with cultural influences from both Tughluq and Ilyas. Some of the most noteworthy examples of Sharqi style in Jaunpur , the Atala Masjid, the Lal Darwaza Masjid and the Jama Masjid, all come from this amalgamation of styles. This extends to our majority Hindu subjects as well.  The predominantly Hindu masons and artisans are comfortable with the pillar, beam and bracket system, which is becoming more common by the day"
 jnp_agrarianism_title: "Entrenched Agrarianism"
 jnp_agrarianism_desc: "Our Zamnidars are unfortunately the main source of manpower and wealth, so they hold great sway over the kingdom. As they wish to continue ownership of peasants, they request that the agrarian nature of this kingdom be preserved. This may prove troubling for the future, but for now we can only cave."
 jnp_julaha_title: "Julaha Patronage"
 jnp_julaha_desc: "The Julaha People are a caste of weavers that live in predominantly rural communities. Found all over the Gangetic plain, their works on Kharad and Dhurries have made their works well-known. It has always been important to the Sultan's of the well being of the people, so when these communities begin losing ground to the ever-changing manufacturing sector, it is imperative that we help these people. Dastak's are usually granted in small numbers to limit the market and keep prices high, but this practice has caused suffering. We must alleviate the pain!"
 jnp_riverrine_trade_title: "Riverine Trade"
 jnp_riverrine_trade_desc: "Unlike Bengal, Orissa, Vijayanagar, Gujarat and some of the Deccan states, Jaunpur has no access to the sea. The coastal regions of the subcontinent has become closely linked up with the complex network of an international trade which not only leads to their commercial and industrial progress, but also significantly expedites the growth of new social and professional classes of artisans, merchants, brokers and dealers in these regions. This type of dynamism and mobility in socio-economic sphere is absent or at least restricted in Jaunpur. In spite of this disadvantage, the economy of the region is not adversely affected. The chief reason for this is that a considerable volume of trade in the upper Indo-Gangetic belt iscarried along the river routes. The flow of this riverine trade is temporarily affected during warfare."
 jnp_march_on_delhi_title: "Sharqi's March"
 jnp_march_on_delhi_desc: "As one of the many splinters that spat out of the dying Delhi Sultanate, we have a somewhat tenuous claim to the throne. Now, we are not the only ones to have noticed this, as those semi-loyal to the Sayyids, such as Bahlul Lodi, have begun eyeing up the throne as well. We must choose a time to strike!"
 jnp_where_it_all_began_title: "Where It All Began"
 jnp_where_it_all_began_desc: "Jaunpur's independence stems from Timur's sack of Delhi, and the Sharqi governors styling themselves as "Ruler's of the East". 1394 was the beginning, but new threats have risen beyond the throne of India, such as the Lodi's of Lahore, or the squabbling Timurids beyond the Hindu Kush. The city, despite devastation, still holds many capable administrators from the Tughluq times, which raises the question of what to do with the administrators of old."
 jnp_kick_out_pashtuns_title: "Kicking Out The Pashtuns"
 jnp_kick_out_pashtuns_desc: "Delhi repulsed both the Mongols and the Pashtuns numerous times, yet they still crept through the Khyber and Hindu Kush. Lahore is home to one of these, Bahlul of the Lodi family. Here he poses a threat as his tribe previously held immense sway over the Sayyids. Even now, their tribe poses a challenge to deal with. Subjugation may prove useful temporarily, but an unguarded frontier does nothing but present any budding Afghan or Timurid warlord with opportunity to invade. The city in question, Lahore, was once a centre of great scholars home to more Persianate poets than anywhere other than Teheran. Then Mongol invasion and subsequent sack, and was also the original centre of Islamic culture before Delhi."
 jnp_rajput_relations_title: "Relations with the Rajputs"
 jnp_rajput_relations_desc: "The Rajputs of Northern India are simultaneously diverse and equally difficult to reign in. Either envy or pride drives them, but they are as different from their horseback cousins in Rajputana as a mangoe is from a kiwi. However, the advent of gunpowder has encouraged them to be more pro-active militarily. Most often they are from Bihar and Purvanchal, yet they are seen as far as Ahmedabad, Bidar and Dhaka. Our relationship has the possibility to blossom into a very mutually beneficial one, standardising the large pool of Purbiya mercenaries into a formidable royal guard or even a standing army."
 jnp_control_trunk_title: "Controlling the Trunk"
 jnp_control_trunk_desc: "The Grand Trunk Road stretches from Gaur to Kabul, running along the north of India and lies mostly within our territory. The route carries goods, like the Sadak-e-Azam, along the Ganges, but can easily be stopped by the city of Thatta or Lahore. This must be prevented to maintain our supremacy over Trade."
 jnp_grand_trunk_road_title: "The Grand Truk Road"
 jnp_grand_trunk_road_desc: "The Grand Trunk Road, a trade route so long that its rivals the silk road. Lying across all of the Ganges gives it the advantage of being incredibly strategic. Commanding such a route would enable any army to hasten logistics and improve supply. Let that army be ours."
 jnp_lord_of_hindustan_title: "Lord of Hindustan"
 jnp_lord_of_hindustan_desc: "Lords of East and West, Lords of Knowledge and Elephant, Lords of Horse and Peasant. The might of [Root.GetName] is felt across all of Dar-Al Harb."
 jnp_wishes_of_harem_title: "Wishes of the Harem"
 jnp_wishes_of_harem_desc: "Down south lies the Malwan governors and vassals of Kalpi and Bundhelkhand, who have recently had complaints about their treatment of local muslim women. Understandibly, this has upset much of the local population, who cry out for anyone to avenge their honour. This might well the opportunity we have been waiting for..."
 jnp_push_to_coast_title: "Push to the Coast"
 jnp_push_to_coast_desc: "Now that we have secured our diplomatic position, and hopefully we shall be allowed our rightful conquest, The Sultan of Bengal sits happily on the Bay of Bengal, sucking up all the trade that flows through his kingdom. What is to say that we cannot claim these riches for ourselves again. After all, we are lords of the east, and Bengal happens to be east of [Root.GetName]"
 jnp_thorn_in_our_side_title: "The Thorn in Our Side"
 jnp_thorn_in_our_side_desc: "Numerous times have we been resisted by Kalpi and Malwa. Delhian intervention, political squabbling and a disdain for war have caused our invasions to be temporary or a failure. Well, with great preparation, we finally put to rest what has been decades of trouble."
 jnp_seek_just_war_title: "Seek Just War"
 jnp_seek_just_war_desc: "[Root.GetName]'s last foray into Bengal lead to both the Timurids and Ming ordering us to stand down or face war. While their fear is promising, it would be unfortunate to be embarrased on the global stage again like that. With a miz of bribery and forgery, the coming wars can be crafted into something justifiable, and out of the way of intervention."
 jnp_campaign_in_orissa_title: "Campaign in Orissa"
 jnp_campaign_in_orissa_desc: "Kapilendra Hugs the coast of the Bay of Bengal, and his territory stretches from Bengal to Vijayanagar. His army is formidable and thus we will struggle to conquer the region. However, His army gets its strength from Elephants, where they have utilised the magnificent creatures to great advantige. It would be wise to "learn" the knowledge of their warfare."
 jnp_lord_of_orissa_title: "Lord of the Elephants"
 jnp_lord_of_orissa_desc: "Hannibal? Who's that."
 jnp_issue_land_title: "Issuing Land Grants"
 jnp_issue_land_desc: "Land is distributed through 3 methods. Iqta land is given as a subsidiary instead of outright payment for officials, as thanks for their services. Khalisa land is the Sultan's own, and the revenue generated is used to fund the royal household. Finally, Inam land is for religious officials to appease the clergy. In order to prevent disaster once again, we must find a balance between patronage and preventing puppet status."
 jnp_follow_indus_title: "Following the Indus"
 jnp_follow_indus_desc: "The Sind Sultanate continues to reject our subjugation. This wouldn't be too much of an issue, but the Sultanates control over the Indus river has the potential to strangle the city of Multan. Since we now have a launch pad down the river, it would be wise to secure our economic hegemony."
 jnp_city_of_taj_title: "The City of the Taj"
 jnp_city_of_taj_desc: "A city lies on the banks of the Yamuna, dating back to the legends of Krishna and Mahabharata. While not nearly as grand as [Root.GetName] once was, it is in a prime position in the centre of the Doab to grow, with local bazars and entrepots already established. With some effort, the city could become a principle administrative centre, and the heart of [Root.GetName]'s resurgence"
 jnp_malvi_architecture_title: "Malvi Architecture"
 jnp_malvi_architecture_desc: "Malwa, while unruly, appeared to have used their time effectively, resulting in many great works of art and architecture. While it is custom to destroy and pillage, there is something about the place that stifles the Sultan, for he has become infatuated with Mandu, the Capital. The Jahaz Mahal, Rani Ruptami Pavilion and the Delhi Darwaza still stand after the conquest, and it is imperative to preserver these monuments."
 jnp_bengali_jamdani_title: "Bengali Jamdani"
 jnp_bengali_jamdani_desc: "While it is upsetting that Bengal has flourished without our administration, The previous Sultans have indeed left us a territory with great potential. The city of Dhaka is one example, with thousands of weavers producing the most beautiful works of fabric ever seen by the Sultan."
 jnp_returning_gujarat_title: "Returning to Gujarat"
 jnp_returning_gujarat_desc: "The Gujarati Sultans hold immense riches and power over the Arabian gulf, with links to both the Horse and Cloth trade. It's no wonder that the Europeans sailed around a continent just to retain access to these markets. In the past, their independence was met with plunder, yet we could never retain control for the populace did not want it. With promises of greater mercantile freedom, we may be met with slightly less resistance"

 ###EVENTS###
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.1.t: "Ujjainiya"
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.1.d: "The Ujjainiyas are a Rajput clan residing in Bihar. The arrival of Muslim powers was not received well by the martial and Hindu Rajputs, with the Ujjainiyas causing problems throughout the late 14th and early 15th centuries. It is believed to have started due to the Sultanate's... interference with the heathen Brahmins at Buxar. The Rajputs came to their defence and made grounds against the army of the Sultan.\n\nWhile the main head of resistance, Raja Harraj, long dead, the war is still on, and until we can flush out the invaders, their presence will cause harm for years."
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.1.opt1: "All this over a few priests?!"

 ME_Jaunpur_Events.2.t: "Administering Delhi"
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.2.d: "Our recent conquest of Delhi has presented us with a unique opportunity. The city is well positioned on the Ganges, and allows us to project power even further. They have capable administrators, contrary to the recent disorder of the Sayyids, and their form of governance has proven able. On the other hand, Integrating the local nobility will cause issues with our own zamindars. The future of Hindustan may require change, and that change sees the legacy of Delhi as nothing more than a memory. All of Hindustan holds its breath."
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.2.opt1: "Our place lies in the Throne of India"
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.2.opt2: "Out with the old!"

 ME_Jaunpur_Events.3.t: "Banarasidas"
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.3.d: "Banarasidas was born in a Shrimal Jain family in 1587. His father Kharagsen was a jeweller in Jaunpur. He received basic education in letters and numbers from a local Brahmin in Jaunpur for one year and then from another Brahmin named Pandit Devdatt at the age of 14. Banarasidas is known for his works, Moha Vivek Yuddha, Banārasi Nāmamāla Banārasivilāsa, Samayasāra Nātaka and Ardhakathanaka in Braj Bhasa. He is also endowed in his Trade Interest, due to his handling of deals on Paper."
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.3.opt1: "Our Connections to the Jain community have paid off"

 ME_Jaunpur_Events.4.t: "The Magic Doe"
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.4.d: "Mirigavati is the work of Shaikh Qutban Suhravardi, an Indian Sufi master who is also an expert poet and storyteller attached to the glittering court of The Sultan. His powerful Hindavi Sufi romance is a richly layered and sophisticated text, simultaneously a spiritual enigma and an exciting love story full of adventures. The Mirigavati draws freely on the large pool of Indian, Islamic, and European narrative motifs in its distinctive telling of a mystical quest and its resolution. Adventures from the Odyssey and the voyages of Sindbad the Sailor--sea voyages, encounters with monstrous serpents, damsels in distress, flying demons and cannibals in caves, among others, surface in Suhravardi 's rollicking tale."
 ME_Jaunpur_Events.4.opt1: "An epic romance that holds the key to Sufi traditions!"
