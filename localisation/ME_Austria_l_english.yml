 ME_Austria_Events.1.t: "The Swabian Matter"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.d: "With our recent victories in Swabia, the people there lie humbled before us as our armies establish control of the region. It is the land where once great emperors like Friedrich Barbarossa ruled from, projecting their power upon the many imperial princes. We can decide to subjugate them, or perhaps it is time to unify Germany by force."
 ME_Austria_Events.1.a: "Let us demand subjugation"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.b: "A Swabian march would be fitting"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.c: "This is the start of our German ambitions"

 ME_Austria_Events.2.t: "Who Brings Shadow"
 ME_Austria_Events.2.d: "With the rebellious Italian princes wanting to break free from the Empire, the Imperial court is faced with a hard decision. The Shadow Kingdom, as powerful as it stands, must be destroyed. The means do an end do not matter, only that action is taken. What shall we do?"
 ME_Austria_Events.2.a: "Let us integrate them diplomatically!"

With a wide array of muskets, swords and artillery, we can decide to safeguard it all in this place, serving as a museum to serve as a beacon of our military prowess. Alternatively, we can use these weapons to innovate our current ones."
 ME_Austria_Events.3.a: "It shall not only be a museum."
 ME_Austria_Events.3.b: "We shall examine the weapons and armor to innovate ours."

 ME_Austria_Events.6.b: "Let him keep his reforms to his reign only."

 ME_Austria_Events.7.t: "A Union with Iberia"
 ME_Austria_Events.7.d: "With the France's rise to power we know that Germany alone will not be enough to keep them at check. Iberia, also an enemy of the French for a long time is in a similar position with us. Establishing connections with them may finally lead to the fighting force we need."
 ME_Austria_Events.7.a: "We shall"
 ME_Austria_Events.7.b: "We will enforce this union instead."

 ME_Austria_Events.8.t: "A Habsburg Union"

 ME_Austria_Events.9.t: "The Habsburg Wedding"
 ME_Austria_Events.9.d: "WIth our Habsburg heir finally coming of age, it is time to decide. He himself rules Austria and the Holy Roman Empire. If we fall under his rule we may be well under their protection."
 ME_Austria_Events.9.a: "Charles will lead us to greatness!"
 ME_Austria_Events.9.b: "No Habsburg prince will look out for us."

 ME_Austria_Events.10.t: "A Balanced Court"
 ME_Austria_Events.10.d: "The estates have been controlling our every decision for far too long. All united against ruining our rule, looking out for themselves. Instead, how about we make it so the estates fight against eachother? Give them the proper privileges to steer enough conflict, and reap the benefits of their discord."
 ME_Austria_Events.10.a: "They will remember who truly rules them soon enough."

 ME_Austria_Events.11.t: "Founding of the Nordmark"
 ME_Austria_Events.11.d: "In the early days of the Holy Roman Empire, in the areas of Saxony stood Nordmark, the Northern March of the Empire. Its purpose was to fight off the invaders from Poland, Prussia and Scandinavia. The remainder of that realm is the Prince-Electorate of Brandenburg. Is it time to restore this ancient march?"
 ME_Austria_Events.11.a: "We shall establish them as our vassal."

 ME_Austria_Events.12.t: "An Offer of Marshalship"

Their legacy will not be forgotten in Europe."

 ME_Austria_Events.13.b: "We will keep their provinces"
 ME_Austria_Events.13.c: "Our Northern March could use some of that land"

 ME_Austria_Events.14.t: "Privilegium Maius"
 ME_Austria_Events.14.d: "Rudolf IV von Habsburg's document, dubbed 'Privilegium Maius', was an important milestone for the von Habsburgs. Forged during his rivalry with Charles IV von Luxembourg, it served the purpose of empowering the Duchy of Austria, raising its status into an Archduchy. The document however was never truly recognized by the Imperial council nor the Emperor. With [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] as the Emperor of the Romans we can solidify the Greater Privilege"
 ME_Austria_Events.14.a: "Austriae est imperare orbi universo!"

 ME_Austria_Events.15.t: "The Balkan Frontier"
 ME_Austria_Events.15.d: "With our victories in Serbia and Bosnia, the people there have been subjugated.

The Orthodox churched tried to project dominance on the Pope in Rome, but with the Franks their influence started failing. Charlemagne, Father of Europe crowned himself Emperor of the Romans, claiming the imperial legacy from Byzantium. With Constantinople under our rule, we can finally decide to end these Greek pretenders."

 ME_Austria_Events.16.b: "They can be an 'Empire'......as our vassal."

 ME_Austria_Events.17.t: "The Burgundian Succession"
 ME_Austria_Events.17.d: "Phillip the Good of Burgundy had greatly expanded his realm into Imperial territory.

 ME_Austria_Events.17.b: "We will use our ties for integration."

 ME_Austria_Events.18.t: "The Fate of Switzerland"
 ME_Austria_Events.18.d: "The battle of Sempach was a devastating blow for the Austrian nobility. It served as a grave reminder for the Austrians of why the Swiss were feared amongst Europeans. Yet with that defeat came a sentiment: Revenge. The Swiss Confederation had expanded, but the Habsburgs became more centralized, with the Imperial Throne to back them up. Their fate is now for us to dictate."
 ME_Austria_Events.18.a: "They are still German. No need for harsh treatment."
 ME_Austria_Events.18.b: "We will not forget our previous humilation against them."

 ME_Austria_Events.19.t: "A Confederation of South Germans"

 ME_Austria_Events.20.t: "Founding a New Fleet"
 ME_Austria_Events.20.d: "With the rest of the European powers advancing their shipbuilding technology, we are left behind in the race to the sea. Whilst we are not the greatest sailors, numerous of our coastal cities have eager recruits, wishing to join the navy. One question still remains though. How will this new fleet be built?"
 ME_Austria_Events.20.a: "A fleet, worthy that to rival any other."
 ME_Austria_Events.20.b: "Let us take a lesson from Venice."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.21.t: "The Kingdom of Naples"
 ME_Austria_Events.21.d: "Frederick II Hohenstaufen, King of Naples, claimed the Imperial Throne for himself during the 13th century.

[Root.Monarch.GetName] wishes to re-create such magnificent reign."
 ME_Austria_Events.21.a: "We shall be in direct rule."
 ME_Austria_Events.21.b: "Grant them some autonomy."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.22.t: "The Austrian Iron"
 ME_Austria_Events.22.d: "The Austrian lands are filled with iron. From the mines of Innsbruck, to the forests of Graz iron is the main product.

Our advisors suggest we exploit this wealth, whilst the merchants demands that we invest in these lands."

 ME_Austria_Events.22.b: "How about a long-term investment?"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.23.t: "Foundation of the Directory"
 ME_Austria_Events.23.d: "Austria is in dire need of reforms. With the nobility and the estates de-centralizing the lands much of our crown is left inefficient. Many court officials, layers, students, and so on have proposed us the following: the creation of an administrative body, dubbed the Directory, that will be responsible for centralization and bureaucratic matters."
 ME_Austria_Events.23.a: "With this new administration, the estates influence will be lowered."
 ME_Austria_Events.23.b: "They are here to help us, not ruin us."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.24.t: "Bohemian Gold"
 ME_Austria_Events.24.d: ""
 ME_Austria_Events.24.a: "Excellent."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.25.t: "Franz Anton von Raab's Reforms"
 ME_Austria_Events.25.d: "What is the point of having land in this realm if the nobles control it? What's the benefit of our people when they serve as serfs or levies for the aristocracy? Franz Anton von Raab, a minister in the Austrian court, has proposed to us a change. His reforms aim to strip the nobility from their people and lands, making their role in the realm to be insignificant, with their only duty being to serve the crown."

 ME_Austria_Events.32.d: "Many, many decades have passed since the schism between Emperor and Pope. We, the Pope, believe that the Emperor's power comes from us, as it is God who gives them their power, and we are a representative of God. They however believe that it is the Emperor who is above us, since it is he who protects the Pope from his enemies."
 ME_Austria_Events.32.a: "We will submit to them."
 ME_Austria_Events.32.b: "If they truly believe that, then God will favor them on the field of battle."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.33.t: "Ladislaus' Succession"
 ME_Austria_Events.33.d: "Ladislaus Postumus von Habsburg inherited the Bohemian lands from his father, Albert II of Germany. Despite that, the Hussites in Prague refuse to acknowledge him as King of Bohemia. The main body of the regency wishes to rule their own way, rather of how we command them, and only the Duke of Moravia has pledged his support to us."
 ME_Austria_Events.33.a: "Demand the crown of Bohemia."
 ME_Austria_Events.33.b: "We do not want the crown, but their land."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.34.t: "Albert's Will"

 ME_Austria_Events.36.d: "The rebellious nobles of Bohemia have been pacified. With no dubious people in Prague, and all the counts and dukes under our control, our reign there is supreme. [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his men are full aware of this, and are preparing for an official ceremony."

 ME_Austria_Events.37.t: "Where Holy Roman Emperors Once Ruled"
 ME_Austria_Events.37.d: "Prague is the Empire's Jewel. With Charles IV von Luxembourg making it into the greatest city in Europe, the people there prospered. With a palace so grand a university filled with many great people, it is truly a magnificent city. Our recent constructions as well have led it to thrive even more."
 ME_Austria_Events.37.a: "Prague shall serve as a beacon of our glorious rule."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.38.t: "Kingdom of Lombardy"
 ME_Austria_Events.38.d: "The Italian people have been rebellious to Imperial rule for too long. With many republics, duchies, free cities, and leagues in the region it was impossible to properly control them all. Our rule in the area however have led many to believe otherwise."

 ME_Austria_Events.28.d: "Our diplomats in Venice have been successful in their task. Many wealthy families have heard of our rule, along with the prosperity and tolerance we have brought into every place we conquered. A debate however has sprung in the Doge's palace. Is the Holy Roman Empire strong enough to protect them? Whilst we do not know what they truly want, we can send them an invitation hoping for the best."
 ME_Austria_Events.28.a: "They will not refuse our offer."

 ME_Austria_Events.41.d: "If you want peace, prepare for war. Rather than slowly preparing our military for war, having an army ready at all times will help us both in peace-time and in war-time.
