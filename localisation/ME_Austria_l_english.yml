 ME_hab_enemies_of_the_empire_title: "Enemies of the Empire"
 ME_hab_enemies_of_the_empire_desc: "The German lands may be prospering under our reign, but we are surrounded by enemies. Both internally and externally, our rivals scheme our downfall. Let us project our might to them, showing them what Austrians are made of"
 ME_hab_steps_of_reform_title: "Steps of Reform"
 ME_hab_steps_of_reform_desc: "Our popularity in Germany in unparalleled. Many have been praising us for our benevolent reign, following our every word, like true subjects should. Let us get one step closer to uniting this realm"
 ME_hab_a_realm_reborn_title: "A Realm Reborn"
 ME_hab_a_realm_reborn_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is diseased, rotten to the core. There is no saving it, we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the slate clean, reform it all! And from the discord, a new Empire will be born. Evolved but untamed! The electors will be purged and the monarchs will thrive, free to live as they see fit, they will make the Empire great again!"
 ME_hab_management_of_the_estates_title: "Management of the Estates"
 ME_hab_management_of_the_estates_desc: "With the ending of the feudal system in our realm, it is time to reform our bureaucracy. To accomplish that however, we need to deal with the classes in power. Our estates, for a long time, have been influencing and controlling our lands against our interests. Let us placate them before dealing them a final blow."
 ME_hab_our_westward_enemy_title: "Our Westward Enemy"
 ME_hab_our_westward_enemy_desc: "The Burgundian lands have made a great addition to our realm. Providing us with more men and money has helped with our grip in Western Europe. There are, however, monarchs who wish to see it weaken once again. The French have long conflicted with the Emperors of the Germanic people. We must break this status quo in this conflict lest the tides turn against us. The Empire now looks westwards."
 ME_hab_balkanize_france_title: "Balkanize France"
 ME_hab_balkanize_france_desc: "France is but a part of the once glorious Carolingian Empire. An Empire of whom we are the successors of. Instead of allowing the French kings and their pride in their sovereignty, we should show them who the true masters of Europe are. Tonight, we shall dine in Paris."
 ME_hab_secure_lubeck_title: "Secure Lubeck"
 ME_hab_secure_lubeck_desc: "In the Northern part of the Empire lies the Hanseatic Trade, filled with riches of Scandinavia, Germany and Russia. It would be foolish to not strengthen our grip there. With our recent development in Lubeck, that claim may become a reality."
 ME_hab_the_imperial_edges_title: "The Imperial Edges"
 ME_hab_the_imperial_edges_desc: "Our enemies are many, and our allies are few. As the protector of the Empire it is our duty to ensure its borders remain safe. We may face threats from all sides, but they themselves are entangled in their own matters. Let us push this advantage before it is too late."
 ME_hab_redraw_imperial_borders_title: "Redraw the Borders"
 ME_hab_redraw_imperial_borders_desc: "What is an Empire if it cannot expand anymore? With our edges secured, we can finally seek to expand the Empire once again. But who will be our first target? The arrogant French in our west? The rebellious Italians in the south? Or perhaps the Polish people in the east?"
 ME_hab_barbarossas_legacy_title: "Barbarossa's Legacy"
 ME_hab_barbarossas_legacy_desc: "The once great Emperor of the Romans stood atop his castle, looking down on the greatest realm Europe had ever seen. His Empire touched the borders of every major European region, and his authority was unparalleled. Ever since his death however that realm has been in decline. To honor his legacy, we shall restore this lost glory of his."
 ME_hab_a_magnificent_court_title: "A Magnificent Court"
 ME_hab_a_magnificent_court_desc: "The von Habsburgs have been on the rise. First starting as the rulers of only a castle, now as emperors. With this rise in influence many great people have been arriving at our court. Mayhap it is time to put them to great use."
 ME_hab_unite_the_realm_title: "Unite the Realm"
 ME_hab_unite_the_realm_desc: "Austria had never been united. Split between Styria and Tyrol, the nobles always controlled our politics. In order to deal with this problem we must deal to them a decisive blow, one that they will never recover from. One Crown, one Ruler."
 ME_hab_settling_a_score_title: "Settling a Score"
 ME_hab_settling_a_score_desc: "We have always been in conflict with the Papacy in Rome. After all, they are the ones which give the monarchs of Europe power. Often times they punish those who do not follow their will. This can be problematic for our legitimacy. To counter this we shall finally deal with an old conflict between Pope and Emperor."
 ME_hab_burgundian_inheritance_title: "Burgundian Inheritance"
 ME_hab_burgundian_inheritance_desc: "Ever since the start of the Hundred Years War, Burgundy has been expanding. Phillip the Good may have stolen the Low Countries from us, but this yoke will not continue forever. His land will be split sooner of later, be it by conflict or by hunting accident. Until then, we shall wait."
 ME_hab_papal_relations_title: "Papal Relations"
 ME_hab_papal_relations_desc: "With the Italian matter at our hand, only puzzle piece is left untouched. The Pope, pridefully sitting at his seat in Rome is awaiting for the events to unfold. Instead of allowing him to sit back and wait, it is better if we force him into a position. For the future of Italy depends on our actions here."
 ME_hab_talks_with_the_hansa_title: "Talks with the Hansa"
 ME_hab_talks_with_the_hansa_desc: "The Hanseatic League has been in decline over the past few years. With the rise of Denmark and Poland, we cannot sit idly whilst they control the affairs there. Their concerns shall be represented by us, backed by a few swords and guns."
 ME_hab_early_industralization_title: "Early Industrialization"
 ME_hab_early_industralization_desc: "Men in fields may be able to produced goods, but it is never enough. In order to strengthen our production we must look beyond the ability of man. Machines shall do the heavy lifting in production, whilst the people will control those machines. With this theory, our economy shall thrive."
 ME_hab_aeiou_title: "A.E.I.O.U."
 ME_hab_aeiou_desc: "It is Austria's destiny to rule the world. For such ambitions, one must have humble beginnings. Not long ago we were vassals of the von Luxemburgs. Now, we wear the imperial crown, ready to project its power to any who defy us. The Imperial Army will be stronger than before, with even more men and weapons at its disposal. the princes shall learn of our benevolent rule, even if force has to be applied. A.E.I.O.U."
 ME_hab_secure_elector_votes_title: "Secure Elector Votes"
 ME_hab_secure_elector_votes_desc: "Whilst it is our destiny to be the leader of the Empire, the Golden Bull of 1356 has made such possibility a challenge. In order to maintain our position the various electors have to be pleased, willing to vote for us and for no one else. Even if we have to use bribing or browbeat some of them, we shall do as such."
 ME_hab_secure_bohemia_title: "Control Bohemia"
 ME_hab_secure_bohemia_desc: "The Kingdom of Bohemia has been a vital part of the Empire. With the glorious city of Prague, where previous Emperors once resided. On top of that, the discord that has been created there since the failure at Varna has left us in an opportune spot, ready to claim the crown for ourselves any moment. Will the Bohemian people successfully defy us, or will Austria prevail once more?"
 ME_hab_the_polish_realm_title: "The Polish Realm"
 ME_hab_the_polish_realm_desc: "Stiopa"
 ME_hab_the_austrian_culture_title: "Austrian Culture"
 ME_hab_the_austrian_culture_desc: "The lands populated by Austrians may be vast, but they lack the wealth and population in order to prosper. On top of that, the outdated Feudal system is taking a toll on the workers there. Let us give them new homes, new jobs, and new rewards. Every Austrian in Austria must proper."
 ME_hab_the_mainland_title: "The Mainland"
 ME_hab_the_mainland_desc: "Whilst the majority of the de-jure Austrian lands may be owned by us, there sits two problematic pawns. The Bishopric of Trent and the lands of the von Cilli provide a major obstacle in our security of the homeland. If we are to change that, their lands must be confiscated and their people to pledge loyalty to us."
 ME_hab_germanization_title: "Germanization"
 ME_hab_germanization_desc: "Our realm is vast, populated by a multitude of cultures. Whilst many of them have lived in harmony with our rule, their difference from us has proven problematic in terms of governance. With different laws and different languages, they live autonomously, ignoring our rule. Let us change our course and properly educate them."

 #Events:
 ME_Austria_Events.1.t: "Who Brings Shadow"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.d: "Step by step, our grip on the Italian Peninsula has been declining. Ever since the Pope's authority enlarged and ours diminished, many Italian cities sought to reap such phenomenon and either rebel or leave our Sphere of Influence. We sat and waited for a change until there was no more waiting. They stood up against our rule, seeking more and more autonomy. Our forces, distracted by other conflicts, could not enforce our legitimacy onto them. Our diplomats, standing idly by in other European courts, did not consider negotiating with the princes there in hope of averting their rise in autonomy.\n\nNow, with pressure at our backs, we stand idle no more. Threescore years and Ten, have we watched it all slowly crumble apart. The Imperial princes have come together in talks about such incidents hoping to either avert the situation or let our final hold in Italy fade away."
