 ME_Austria_Events.1.t: "Who Brings Shadow"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.d: "Step by step, our grip on the Italian Peninsula has been declining. Ever since the Pope's authority enlarged and ours diminished, many Italian cities sought to reap such phenomenon and either rebel or leave our Sphere of Influence. We sat and waited for a change until there was no more waiting. They stood up against our rule, seeking more and more autonomy. Our forces, distracted by other conflicts, could not enforce our legitimacy onto them. Our diplomats, standing idly by in other European courts, did not consider negotiating with the princes there in hope of averting their rise in autonomy.\n\nNow, with pressure at our backs, we stand idle no more. Threescore years and Ten, have we watched it all slowly crumble apart. The Imperial princes have come together in talks about such incidents hoping to either avert the situation or let our final hold in Italy fade away."
 ME_Austria_Events.1.a: "We shall convince the Italians with diplomacy."
 ME_Austria_Events.1.b: "Italy is MY kingdom. They shall bend the knee to ME!"
