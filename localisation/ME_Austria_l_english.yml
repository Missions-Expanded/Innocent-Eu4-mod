 ME_Austria_Events.1.t: "The Swabian Matter"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.d: "With our recent victories in Swabia, the people there lie humbled before us as our armies establish control of the region. It is the land where once great emperors like Friedrich Barbarossa ruled from, projecting their power upon the many imperial princes. We can decide to subjugate them, or perhaps it is time to unify Germany by force."
 ME_Austria_Events.1.a: "Let us demand subjugation"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.b: "A Swabian march would be fitting"
 ME_Austria_Events.1.c: "This is the start of our German ambitions"

 ME_Austria_Events.2.t: "Who Brings Shadow"
 ME_Austria_Events.2.d: "With the rebellious Italian princes wanting to break free from the Empire, the Imperial court is faced with a hard decision. The Shadow Kingdom, as powerful as it stands, must be destroyed. The means do an end do not matter, only that action is taken. What shall we do?"
 ME_Austria_Events.2.a: "Let us integrate them diplomatically!"
 ME_Austria_Events.2.b: "Italy is MY kingdom! They shall bend the knee to ME!" 

 ME_Austria_Events.3.t: "Tirol's Armory"
 ME_Austria_Events.3.d: "Tirol's armory consists of some of the finest weaponry in Europe. With a wide array of muskets, swords and artillery, we can decide to safeguard it all in this place, serving as a museum to serve as a beacon of our military prowess. Alternatively, we can use these weapons to innovate our current ones."
 ME_Austria_Events.3.a: "It shall not only be a museum."
 ME_Austria_Events.3.b: "We shall examine the weapons and armor to innovate ours."


 ME_Austria_Events.5.t: "A New Champion in the Joust"
 ME_Austria_Events.5.d: "During a recent jousting tournament, an unheralded commoner surprised all in attendance by besting everyone who faced him until he was declared the champion. Now we face the awkward decision of what to do with him."
 ME_Austria_Events.5.a: "The man must lead our armies!"
 ME_Austria_Events.5.b: "Tighten the rules to make sure this doesn't happen again!"

 ME_Austria_Events.6.t: "An Enlightened Despot"
 ME_Austria_Events.6.d: "With the Enlightenment spreading across the world, our court has taken interest in its studies. [Root.Monarch.GetName] in particularly has started a series of reforms, declaring himself as an Enlightened Despot. His ideas look promising, but many nobles and clergymen seem to dislike it."
 ME_Austria_Events.6.a: "Those ideas shall serve as an example for our new administration."
 ME_Austria_Events.6.b: "Let him keep his reforms to his reign only."

 ME_Austria_Events.7.t: "A Union with Iberia"
 ME_Austria_Events.7.d: "With the France's rise to power we know that Germany alone will not be enough to keep them at check. Iberia, also an enemy of the French for a long time is in a similar position with us. Establishing connections with them may finally lead to the fighting force we need."
 ME_Austria_Events.7.a: "We shall"
 ME_Austria_Events.7.b: "We will enforce this union instead."

 ME_Austria_Events.8.t: "A Habsburg Union"
 ME_Austria_Events.8.d: "The Austrians have send us an offer: to unite against the rising French threat. A marriage between the two houses may serve to benefit is quite well...."

 ME_Austria_Events.9.t: "The Habsburg Wedding"
 ME_Austria_Events.9.d: "WIth our Habsburg heir finally coming of age, it is time to decide. He himself rules Austria and the Holy Roman Empire. If we fall under his rule we may be well under their protection."
 ME_Austria_Events.9.a: "Charles will lead us to greatness!"
 ME_Austria_Events.9.b: "No Habsburg prince will look out for us."

 ME_Austria_Events.10.t: "A Balanced Court"
 ME_Austria_Events.10.d: "The estates have been controlling our every decision for far too long. All united against ruining our rule, looking out for themselves. Instead, how about we make it so the estates fight against eachother? Give them the proper privileges to steer enough conflict, and reap the benefits of their discord."
 ME_Austria_Events.10.a: "They will remember who truly rules them soon enough."

 ME_Austria_Events.11.t: "Founding of the Nordmark"
 ME_Austria_Events.11.d: "In the early days of the Holy Roman Empire, in the areas of Saxony stood Nordmark, the Northern March of the Empire. Its purpose was to fight off the invaders from Poland, Prussia and Scandinavia. The remainder of that realm is the Prince-Electorate of Brandenburg. Is it time to restore this ancient march?"
 ME_Austria_Events.11.a: "We shall establish them as our vassal."
 ME_Austria_Events.11.b: "We'll make use of their lands into great extend."

 ME_Austria_Events.12.t: "An Offer of Marshalship"
 ME_Austria_Events.12.d: "[From.GetName] has offered us an ultimatum. They demand that we become their new 'Northern March' against their enemies."

 ME_Austria_Events.13.t: "The Legacy of the Teutonic Order"
 ME_Austria_Events.13.d: "During the Late Middle Ages, German crusader knights named the Teutonic Order led numerous crusades against the Pagans of the Baltic Sea. They were feared amongst the land and were considered the finest knights Europe had to offer. Their headquarters were in Marienburg, part of the Prussian lands. Their legacy will not be forgotten in Europe."
 ME_Austria_Events.13.a: "We shall restore them to their land"
 ME_Austria_Events.13.b: "We will keep their provinces"
 ME_Austria_Events.13.c: "Our Northern March could use some of that land"

 ME_Austria_Events.14.t: "Privilegium Maius"
 ME_Austria_Events.14.d: "Rudolf IV von Habsburg's document, dubbed 'Privilegium Maius', was an important milestone for the von Habsburgs. Forged during his rivalry with Charles IV von Luxembourg, it served the purpose of empowering the Duchy of Austria, raising its status into an Archduchy. The document however was never truly recognized by the Imperial council nor the Emperor. With [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] as the Emperor of the Romans we can solidify the Greater Privilege"
 ME_Austria_Events.14.a: "Austriae est imperare orbi universo!"

 ME_Austria_Events.15.t: "The Balkan Frontier"
 ME_Austria_Events.15.d: "With our victories in Serbia and Bosnia, the people there have been subjugated.

 ME_Austria_Events.15.b: "Their lands will truly prosper under us."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.16.t: "Uniting the Two Romes"
 ME_Austria_Events.16.d: "With the fall of the Western Empire, the Dark Ages had started. The Emperors in Constantinople claimed to be the true successors to Rome whilst their Empire was crumbling. The Orthodox churched tried to project dominance on the Pope in Rome, but with the Franks their influence started failing. Charlemagne, Father of Europe crowned himself Emperor of the Romans, claiming the imperial legacy from Byzantium. With Constantinople under our rule, we can finally decide to end these Greek pretenders."
 ME_Austria_Events.16.a: "The Crown is mine."
 ME_Austria_Events.16.b: "They can be an 'Empire'......as our vassal."

 ME_Austria_Events.17.t: "The Burgundian Succession"
 ME_Austria_Events.17.d: "Phillip the Good of Burgundy had greatly expanded his realm into Imperial territory. Gaining Luxembourg and the Lowlands during his reign, he was a major threat for the Holy Roman Emperors. How legacy however now lays shattered, as the Burgundian Realm lies shattered and divided between us and the French."
 ME_Austria_Events.17.a: "We will maintain them as a realm between us and the French."
 ME_Austria_Events.17.b: "We will use our ties for integration."

 ME_Austria_Events.18.t: "The Fate of Switzerland"
 ME_Austria_Events.18.d: "The battle of Sempach was a devastating blow for the Austrian nobility. It served as a grave reminder for the Austrians of why the Swiss were feared amongst Europeans. Yet with that defeat came a sentiment: Revenge. The Swiss Confederation had expanded, but the Habsburgs became more centralized, with the Imperial Throne to back them up. Their fate is now for us to dictate."
 ME_Austria_Events.18.a: "They are still German. No need for harsh treatment."
 ME_Austria_Events.18.b: "We will not forget our previous humilation against them."

 ME_Austria_Events.19.t: "A Confederation of South Germans"
 ME_Austria_Events.19.d: "Germany had always been divided. Even with the Imperial Crown as a reminder, the many dukes and barons always fought each other for power. [Root.Monarch.GetName] However has managed to unite Southern Germany, wishing to finally end these conflicts. He visions a land of Germans, where they're equal despite of culture, the South German Confederation."
 ME_Austria_Events.19.a: "Equality amongst the people."
 ME_Austria_Events.19.b: "Even confederations need leaders."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.20.t: "Founding a New Fleet"
 ME_Austria_Events.20.d: "With the rest of the European powers advancing their shipbuilding technology, we are left behind in the race to the sea. Whilst we are not the greatest sailors, numerous of our coastal cities have eager recruits, wishing to join the navy. One question still remains though. How will this new fleet be built?"
 ME_Austria_Events.20.a: "A fleet, worthy that to rival any other."
 ME_Austria_Events.20.b: "Let us take a lesson from Venice."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.21.t: "The Kingdom of Naples"
 ME_Austria_Events.21.d: "Frederick II Hohenstaufen, King of Naples, claimed the Imperial Throne for himself during the 13th century. His reign saw many changes in the Imperial system, but ultimately it was in his reign that most of Italy, including Naples, was under the Imperial Crown. [Root.Monarch.GetName] wishes to re-create such magnificent reign."
 ME_Austria_Events.21.a: "We shall be in direct rule."
 ME_Austria_Events.21.b: "Grant them some autonomy."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.22.t: "The Austrian Iron"
 ME_Austria_Events.22.d: "The Austrian lands are filled with iron. From the mines of Innsbruck, to the forests of Graz iron is the main product. We have used it to great lengths to bolster the economy, and have made great profit from it. But there is still more to be done about it. Our advisors suggest we exploit this wealth, whilst the merchants demands that we invest in these lands."
 ME_Austria_Events.22.a: "We shall exploit this trade."
 ME_Austria_Events.22.b: "How about a long-term investment?"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.23.t: "Foundation of the Directory"
 ME_Austria_Events.23.d: "Austria is in dire need of reforms. With the nobility and the estates de-centralizing the lands much of our crown is left inefficient. Many court officials, layers, students, and so on have proposed us the following: the creation of an administrative body, dubbed the Directory, that will be responsible for centralization and bureaucratic matters."
 ME_Austria_Events.23.a: "With this new administration, the estates influence will be lowered."
 ME_Austria_Events.23.b: "They are here to help us, not ruin us."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.24.t: "Bohemian Gold"
 ME_Austria_Events.24.d: ""
 ME_Austria_Events.24.a: "Excellent."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.25.t: "Franz Anton von Raab's Reforms"
 ME_Austria_Events.25.d: "What is the point of having land in this realm if the nobles control it? What's the benefit of our people when they serve as serfs or levies for the aristocracy? Franz Anton von Raab, a minister in the Austrian court, has proposed to us a change. His reforms aim to strip the nobility from their people and lands, making their role in the realm to be insignificant, with their only duty being to serve the crown."
 ME_Austria_Events.25.a: "The nobility will bend the knee to me!"
 ME_Austria_Events.25.b: "We are forever indebted to them."

 ME_Austria_Events.30.a: "Fantastic"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.32.t: "Emperor Above Pope"
 ME_Austria_Events.32.d: "Many, many decades have passed since the schism between Emperor and Pope. We, the Pope, believe that the Emperor's power comes from us, as it is God who gives them their power, and we are a representative of God. They however believe that it is the Emperor who is above us, since it is he who protects the Pope from his enemies."
 ME_Austria_Events.32.a: "We will submit to them."
 ME_Austria_Events.32.b: "If they truly believe that, then God will favor them on the field of battle."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.33.t: "Ladislaus' Succession"
 ME_Austria_Events.33.d: "Ladislaus Postumus von Habsburg inherited the Bohemian lands from his father, Albert II of Germany. Despite that, the Hussites in Prague refuse to acknowledge him as King of Bohemia. The main body of the regency wishes to rule their own way, rather of how we command them, and only the Duke of Moravia has pledged his support to us."
 ME_Austria_Events.33.a: "Demand the crown of Bohemia."
 ME_Austria_Events.33.b: "We do not want the crown, but their land."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.34.t: "Albert's Will"
 ME_Austria_Events.34.d: "With Albert IV's death, his successor Ladislaus Postumus wishes to be properly crowned as King of Bohemia. He is now the undisputed successor, and is now getting prepared in case we refuse his offer. What shall we do?"

 ME_Austria_Events.36.t: "The Crown of Bohemia"
 ME_Austria_Events.36.d: "The rebellious nobles of Bohemia have been pacified. With no dubious people in Prague, and all the counts and dukes under our control, our reign there is supreme. [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his men are full aware of this, and are preparing for an official ceremony."
 ME_Austria_Events.36.a: "Archduke of Austria and King of Bohemia."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.37.t: "Where Holy Roman Emperors Once Ruled"
 ME_Austria_Events.37.d: "Prague is the Empire's Jewel. With Charles IV von Luxembourg making it into the greatest city in Europe, the people there prospered. With a palace so grand a university filled with many great people, it is truly a magnificent city. Our recent constructions as well have led it to thrive even more."
 ME_Austria_Events.37.a: "Prague shall serve as a beacon of our glorious rule."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.38.t: "Kingdom of Lombardy"
 ME_Austria_Events.38.d: "The Italian people have been rebellious to Imperial rule for too long. With many republics, duchies, free cities, and leagues in the region it was impossible to properly control them all. Our rule in the area however have led many to believe otherwise."

 ME_Austria_Events.27.t: "Schwaz Silver Mine"
 ME_Austria_Events.27.d: "While new deposits of silver had been found in the Schwaz mining district by the early 15th century production have not begun to pick up until now. Greater and greater quantities are being taken out of the mines and with the annual extraction reaching 11 tonnes the area has gained a reputation as the biggest silver mine in Europe."
 ME_Austria_Events.27.a: "Great!"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.69.t: "An 'Invitation' to the Empire"
 ME_Austria_Events.69.d: "Our diplomats in Venice have been successful in their task. Many wealthy families have heard of our rule, along with the prosperity and tolerance we have brought into every place we conquered. A debate however has sprung in the Doge's palace. Is the Holy Roman Empire strong enough to protect them? Whilst we do not know what they truly want, we can send them an invitation hoping for the best."
 ME_Austria_Events.69.a: "They will not refuse our offer."
 ME_Austria_Events.69.b: "I do not wish for more rebellious princes."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.29.t: "[From.GetName] Demands we join the Empire"

 ME_Austria_Events.29.b: "We do not need your protection"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.40.t: "The War Council"
 ME_Austria_Events.40.d: "The monarch and the nobility are not able to control every possible logistical and strategic task by themselves. Many of our officers and generals are veterans, and have knowledge on such challenges. Assigning them in the War Council, as well as making them responsible for raising the new generation for this task."
 ME_Austria_Events.40.a: "Our armies will be more organized than ever."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.41.t: "A Standing Army"
 ME_Austria_Events.41.d: "If you want peace, prepare for war. Rather than slowly preparing our military for war, having an army ready at all times will help us both in peace-time and in war-time. With Fredrick Wilhelm von Haugwitz taking notes from other European armies, we will be able to organize our troops, turning their duty into a profession."
 ME_Austria_Events.41.a: "They shall now fear us!"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.44.t: "The Imperial Armory"
 ME_Austria_Events.44.d: "Our advisors have asked us to use the weapons from the Tirol armory. What weapons will it be?"

 ME_Austria_Events.46.a: "We will accept."
 ME_Austria_Events.46.b: "No."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.47.t: "A Baroque Monarchy"
 ME_Austria_Events.47.d: "The Medieval ages have passed. With the increased interest in classical arts and the advancement in that field many nations in Europe have been adopting many of these new ideas. Our advisors suggest that we adopt a new type of monarchy, not one focused on titles, but one focused on the increase of our status in the world."
 ME_Austria_Events.47.a: "It is only natural we evolve"
 ME_Austria_Events.47.b: "Our current government is fine"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.49.t: "The Nobility in the Army"
 ME_Austria_Events.49.d: "For many years decades the nobility have served in our armies not as proper soldiers or leaders, but rather as a way to gain glory, completely disregarding the state's interests. Many a time this has led to bigger and better equipped armies getting humiliated by a more organized smaller band. Even in this age's warfare, the nobles have important positions under them, wishing to lead the armies not for the state, but for their own interest."
 ME_Austria_Events.49.a: "Their status will be changed."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.50.t: "The Privileges"
 ME_Austria_Events.50.d: "It is in the state's best interests to give rights to people. Some of these rights however can be problematic not only for the state, but for the people as well. The nobility is filled with numerous of 'land exemptions, honorary titles, government positions, military service exemptions', and so on. Commanding them properly has been difficult, as they prefer to sit idly whilst the rest of the nation tries to thrive."
 ME_Austria_Events.50.a: "They sometimes forget who gave them their rights."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.51.t: "Centralization"
 ME_Austria_Events.51.d: "Austria has always been split between different rules, as well as between its nobles. It is hard to raise taxes, or wage war when every other citizen does not know who their actual ruler is. With this in mind, we will pass a number of laws that makes it clear for anyone that it is us who are in charge."
 ME_Austria_Events.51.a: "One ruler, one law."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.52.t: "Edict of Tolerance"
 ME_Austria_Events.52.d: "We are filled with many different cultures and religions. This has led to many rebellions, as well as conflicts between our people. There are no clear laws that protect them from suppression, or even discrimination. Whilst we can ignore them, we must remember that our state is in dire need of modernization, and harassed minorities push us away from that goal."
 ME_Austria_Events.52.a: "We will tolerate no foreigner"
 ME_Austria_Events.52.b: "We must modernize at all costs."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.55.t: "Habsburg Glory"
 ME_Austria_Events.55.d: "Our influence in foreign courts has been growing. It is time to use that influence."
 ME_Austria_Events.55.a: "Let them know the glory of Habsburg."
 ME_Austria_Events.55.b: "We will develop an unshaken reputation."
 ME_Austria_Events.55.c: "Make it so other courts are indebted to us more."
 ME_Austria_Events.55.da: "Let us use this influence to strengthen our court."

 ME_Austria_Events.56.t: "The Emperor Demands Subjugation"
 ME_Austria_Events.56.d: "After our defeats against [From.GetName], they demand that we become their vassal."
 ME_Austria_Events.56.a: "We'd be fools to reject his demands."
 ME_Austria_Events.56.b: "Come what may, we shall live on."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.57.t: "Subjugation of Sclavinia"
 ME_Austria_Events.57.d: "The defeat of Polish armies during the Great Sclavinian War led to the establishment of Imperial control over Poland. With the dukes, counts and archbishops there pledging allegiance to the Emperor, many loyalists have decided to flee, seeking refuge to nearby realms hoping to one day restore Poland under Polish rule."
 ME_Austria_Events.57.a: "We will be back!"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.58.t: "The Imperial Treasury"
 ME_Austria_Events.58.d: "We have been selected! [Emperor.GetName] has decided that the imperial treasury needs a capable prince to manage it, and has decided to appoint us in the position."
 ME_Austria_Events.58.a: "The Imperial funds will be used with great care"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.59.t: "Imperial Marshalship"
 ME_Austria_Events.59.d: "The imperial army is in need of a marshal. [Emperor.GetName] selected us for that position, hoping that we will crush the Empire's enemies in war."
 ME_Austria_Events.59.a: "Under our command, the Imperial army will crush its enemies!"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.60.t: "The Imperial Archbishop"
 ME_Austria_Events.60.d: "With recent religious turmoil and countless church reformations, [Emperor.GetName] has appointed us for the position of Imperial Archbishop."
 ME_Austria_Events.60.a: "Heretics begone!"
 
 ME_Austria_Events.61.t: "Fate of Sclavinia"
 ME_Austria_Events.61.d: "With our foothold in Silesia, many in our court has asked us about Poland, a long-time thorn for the Emperors. Not even people such as Frederick Barbarossa could subdue them, with their only success being at the coastal cities of Prussia. Perhaps being the first one to fully bring Poland into the Empire may have some benefits"
 ME_Austria_Events.61.a: "Sclavinia belongs in the Empire."

 ME_Austria_Events.65.t: "The Hungarian Crown"
 ME_Austria_Events.65.d: "With the death of Vladislaus I Jagiellion Hungary had been left with no ruler. Ladislaus Postumus von Habsburg was the only legitimate successor of Hungary. With the Habsburg rule restored in the area, we can finally start our integration of the Hungarian nobility"
 ME_Austria_Events.65.a: "Their lands, finally ours."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.68.t: "An Offer of Vassalage"
 ME_Austria_Events.68.d: "[From.GetName] has demanded that we become their vassal."
 ME_Austria_Events.68.a: "We cannot stand up against them."
 ME_Austria_Events.68.b: "I'd like to see them try."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.28.t: "Forceful Vassalage"
 ME_Austria_Events.28.d: "The Venetians in the South have been a nuisance for far too long. Their merchants are constantly steering trade away from us, and their armies threatened our Italian rule. With our victories against them we will finally be able to demand subjugation from them."
 ME_Austria_Events.28.a: "We have stood idle for too much."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.560.t: "The Carolingian Legacy"
 ME_Austria_Events.560.d: "The treaty of Verdun split the Carolingian Empire into three realms: Lothair I, ruler of Middle Francia and Italy, Charles II, ruler of West Francia, and Louis II, ruler of East Francia. This treaty has defined the borders of Western Europe, especially between us and the French. With their defeat however we can finally decide what to do with them."
 ME_Austria_Events.560.a: "French? I preferred the Franks."
 ME_Austria_Events.560.b: "With France gone, we will never have to worry about them."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.72.t: "The Art of the Deal"
 ME_Austria_Events.72.d: "The von Habsburgs are said to have connections everywhere. One of these connections are in the court of Burgundy, an affair between [Root.GetName] and Marie of Burgundy, successor to the Duchy of Burgundy. In the wake of [BUR.Monarch.GetName]'s death, we will use that connection to solidify our rightful inheritance."
 ME_Austria_Events.72.a: "Our ties will strengthen."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.73.t: "The University of Vienna"
 ME_Austria_Events.73.d: "Rudolf the Founder, the great ruler of Austria founded the University of Vienna during his rivalry with Charles IV, wishing to elevate Vienna into equal status with Prague. Today the university lacks the funding it needs to function. Many advisors, as well as scholars have pressured us to take action."
 ME_Austria_Events.73.a: "We will sponsor scholars."
 ME_Austria_Events.73.b: "No."

 ME_Austria_Events.76.d: "The count of Cilli has been a nuisance for far too long. It is time to finally end his reign in Slovenia by force."
 ME_Austria_Events.76.a: "His time is near."
 
 ME_Austria_Events.77.t: "The Transylvanian Revolt"
 ME_Austria_Events.77.d: "Most of the Transylvanian nobility have not liked our treatment against them. As such, they have risen up in rebellion, wishing to reclaim their freedom."
 ME_Austria_Events.77.a: "Curse them!"
 
 me_austria_nobles.1.t: "The Nobles Demand Rights"
 me_austria_nobles.1.d: "With our ruler death, the nobles have asked us that we grant them privileges. They seek to support a ruler that will serve them, rather than them wishing to serve us. Failing to meet their demands may lead to unrest, but accepting their demands will only weaken our rule."
 me_austria_nobles.1.a: "Very well."
 me_austria_nobles.1.b: "They can be upset if they want."
 
 me_austria_nobles.2.t: "A Request for Land"
 me_austria_nobles.2.d: "The nobles have new demands. They have been running out of their own personal land, and have asked us to give them some of the crown land in their service. Whilst their demands seem reasonable, several of our advisors have warned us that they still have plenty of land to themselves."
 me_austria_nobles.2.a: "Aye, give them some of the crown's land."
 me_austria_nobles.2.b: "Beggars can't be choosers."
 
 me_austria_nobles.3.t: "Nobles Ask for Army Exemption"
 me_austria_nobles.3.d: "After many battles, the nobles have asked us to grant them exemption from land service. They wish to have more of a commanding position rather than as a common soldier, as vulnerable and weak on the battlefield. Whilst the death of nobles in the battlefield is a great loss, many of our soldiers will feel left out."
 me_austria_nobles.3.a: "Our nobility will not die on the battlefield"
 me_austria_nobles.3.b: "Their blood is as red as the common soldier"
 
 me_austria_nobles.4.t: "Raabisation"
 me_austria_nobles.4.d: "The nobility's reign is coming at an end. Franz Anton von Raab has started enacting a number of radical reforms on land ownership. Many of them are bound to curtail the nobility forever, but they are well aware of this. With each reform he passes, the aristocracy becomes more rebellious. This, however, is the only way to absolute monarchy."
 me_austria_nobles.4.a: "I rule the country, not the nobility"
 me_hab_start_of_raabisation_disaster: "§YThe nobility will fight for their autonomy. Should we win, they will forever be curtailed§!"
 
 me_austria_nobles.5.t: "Revoking Minor Privileges"
 me_austria_nobles.5.d: "How can we wish to strip the aristocratic power away when they hold every single right in the realm? Beginning with their minor privileges, and slowly taking away every one that they have no need for. of course, the nobility will notice of our plan here and will try to act, but if we are careful enough, we will be the defender..."
 me_austria_nobles.5.a: "They have no need of such petty rights."
 me_austria_nobles.5.b: "Perhaps we are being too harsh...."
 me_hab_raab_continues: "§YThe reforms continue...§!"
 me_hab_raab_ends: "§YThe reforms come to an end§!"
 
 me_austria_nobles.6.t: "Usurping Aristocratic Land"
 me_austria_nobles.6.d: "Many of the nobility's lands are underdeveloped, serving only the purpose of them having enough funds to throw crowded feasts every day. With this in mind perhaps it would be best if these lands were under the crown. Our ministry as well as our advisors suggest we spare no efforts in this task."
 me_austria_nobles.6.a: "And what have the nobles ever done with this land?"
 me_austria_nobles.6.b: "We will not shake the very foundation of our system"
 
 me_austria_nobles.7.t: "Supremacy of the Crown"
 me_austria_nobles.7.d: "With both the privileges and the lands removed from the nobility, only one task is left: a show of force. Informing all of the nobles of the realm to swear fealty to [Root.Monarch.GetName], whilst simultaneously passing more laws that limits their powers. Such reform will be met with backlash, but it is for the realm's best interests."
 me_austria_nobles.7.a: "Those who follow me will bend the knee. The rest will die."
 me_austria_nobles.7.b: "We only wanted a new system, not absolute power."
 
 me_austria_nobles.8.t: "Nobility Curtailed"
 me_austria_nobles.8.d: "In the Austrian palace, [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked the nobility who do they serve. They answered by swearing fealty to him. Events like that are a sign that the nobility is loyal, and that their influence has greatly diminished. They will now answer our calls like ordinary people, and will not try to undermine our rule."
 me_austria_nobles.8.a: "The monarch is above the nobles, like it should be."
 
 me_austria_nobles.9.t: "End of Raabisation"
 me_austria_nobles.9.d: "With all the reforms passed, Franz Anton von Raab has officially ended his service to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Whilst they were met with great controversy, the effects cannot be underestimated. We are a modern state, with an absolute monarch and a loyal nobility. The future is now."
