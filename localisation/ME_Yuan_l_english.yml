 YUA_our_rightful_steed_title: "Our Rightful Steed"
 YUA_our_rightful_steed_desc: "Our recent usurpation of the Lawful Mandate gives us some legitimacy in finishing off the violent, weak, and unenlightened Han Chinese. We are the true successors to the land of Qin, and we will force them to acknowledge this."

 YUA_beneath_the_mountains_desc: "Pax Mongolica shall once more shine upon these lands in which our steeds trot; salvation awaits the untimely peasantry of Europe. To that end, we shall ensure safe passage across the Caucasus Mountains, a daunting task to say the least."
 YUA_tibetan_superpowers_title: "Tibetan Superpowers"
 YUA_tibetan_superpowers_desc: "The people of Tibet are more powerful than they let on. They possess incredible miracles and magic, and the plateau is home to many shamans which we would do well to have on our side. Tibet is far too dangerous to leave independent."
 YUA_western_nomads_title: "Western Nomads"

 YUA_restored_ilkhanate_title: "The Restored Ilkhanate"
 YUA_restored_ilkhanate_desc: "Our grand conquests are all but complete. We have one last objective: Persia. The heart of the Ilkhanate itself. This will be a difficult undertaking, but we are the Celestial Empire, the Empire in which the Sun Never Sets! We are the legitimate descendants of Genghis Khan, of the greatest empire of all! We will not be stopped by mere Muslims. Underneath the splendor of Tengri, we shall do the deed and win our place in the world!"
 YUA_proclaim_greater_mongol_empire_title: "Proclaim Greater Mongolia"
 YUA_proclaim_greater_mongol_empire_desc: "We have risen from the Great Khanate to a size even the Mongol Empire could not bear.

We are the greater Mongol Empire. It is time to decide whether to finally rest, or to continue until all that is known is owned."
 YUA_pastoral_pastering_title: "Pastoral Pestering"
 YUA_pastoral_pastering_desc: "The neighboring nomadic Tuvan peoples are weak and pitiful; it would be a mercy to bring them under our control. They would serve our interests well, for they possess the two main necessities in a subject: submission and compliance."

 YUA_taiwanese_expeditions_title: "Taiwanese Expeditions"

 YUA_strategic_river_control_title: "Strategic River Control"
 YUA_strategic_river_control_desc: "The Chinese hold many important estuaries, some of which are going to waste under their neglectful rule. It would be both wise and gracious if we were to take them off of their hands, allowing us to put them to better use."
 YUA_grand_contruction_title: "The Grand Construction"
 YUA_grand_contruction_desc: "Every Mongol attempt at a sea-going navy has failed spectacularly, mostly due to the powerful shamans inhabiting the many islands east of China. All of the shamans of the distance past are now dead, and we can construct a navy without worry."

 YUA_the_dreary_chain_title: "The Dreary Chain"
 YUA_the_dreary_chain_desc: "Even now, the people of Okinawa collaborate with the Japanese to orchestrate our downfall. Using Kyushu as our jumping-off point, we can orchestrate an invasion of the small island chain as well as the large one."

 YUA_city_of_red_hero_desc: "For the past few hundred years, Ih Huree has been a remnant of its former splendor and glory. If the Mongol Empire's untimely demise is to be reversed, we must first restore its roots to its spectacular origins."
 YUA_city_of_the_khan_title: "City of the Khan"
 YUA_city_of_the_khan_desc: "Our rightful Khaganate, if it is to reinforce and surpass the legacy of Kublai Khan, must first acquire the lands that were ripped from the Great Yuan by the heinous Han Chinese.

 YUA_reincoperate_the_goryeo_title: "Reincorporate the Goryeo"
 YUA_reincoperate_the_goryeo_desc: "Ever since the creation of the troublesome Ming Dynasty, the people of Korea have felt angrily towards the Han and sentimental towards the Yuan.

 YUA_bend_the_divine_wind_title: "Bend the Divine Wind"
 YUA_bend_the_divine_wind_desc: "Three hundred years ago, the Japanese tantalizingly sat on their island as we perished by the thousands, guarded by some form of sorcery. This cannot stand as our final image in their eyes, it is an insult and they will pay. The entire continent shall be ours to control by the time we are finished with them."
 YUA_sever_the_drakes_legs_title: "Sever the Drake's Legs"

 ME_Yuan_Events.EVTDESC1: "The already pitiful structure of the Manchuria region has now completely disappeared under our rule, and it is up to us to decide how it should be governed. On one hand, local Mongols could prove beneficial to us if we give them enough incentives, but opportunities also exist to exploit this stark land for military resources on our ever going conquest.
