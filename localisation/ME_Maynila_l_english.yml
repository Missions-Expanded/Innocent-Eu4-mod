 MNA_preparation_title: "Development of Lands"
 MNA_preparation_desc: "With the way that things have currently been going, our nation is close to undergoing some reforms that will change our national spectre in its entirety.

 MNA_reformation_title: "Reformation"
 MNA_reformation_desc: "The tribal, primtive monarchy of our nation has shown our relative weakness against outside powers such as our enemies the Bruneians and the Chinese. For this to be prevented, we have to change our ruling methods and reform into the Luzon Confederacy."
