 # Missions, 1st column
 fin_modernized_finland_title: "A Modernized Finland"
 fin_modernized_finland_desc: "Lying on the fringes of Catholicism, we haven't the administrative benefits provided by modern bureaucratic thought. Ideas rarely spread to White Finland; when they do, we are slow to the taking. Through noble delegation and proper governmental structuring, we will be able to speed up our modernization process."
 fin_unite_finland_title: "Unite Finland"
 fin_unite_finland_desc: "Our ancestral lands remain scattered among tribal lords, owing allegiance to foreign kings before us. It is our destiny to unite Finns everywhere, and to this end, we will fight to the bitter end."
 fin_reclaim_aland_title: "Reclaim Åland"
 fin_reclaim_aland_desc: "Despite the Swedes claiming dominion over the islands, they are merely yet another conquest of the House of Eric. With the Kingdom of Sweden on its last legs, let us obtain what is rightfully ours."
 fin_baltic_fleet_title: "The Baltic Fleet"
 fin_baltic_fleet_desc: "For too long have we resigned naval dominance to the ailing Kalmar Union. The Danes and Swedes can force as many men into the galleys as they wish; it will not save them from the great Finnish oarsmen approaching their shores."
 
 # Missions, 2nd column
 fin_economic_crisis_title: "Economic Crisis"
 fin_economic_crisis_desc: "Cast into the sea by the Swedes, we Finns will determine whether we sink or float. With all its pride, Finland hasn't the riches to sustain itself through the turmoil that shall follow. Construction of a suitable economic base must happen before we can reform our administration or look outwards."
 fin_sisu_title: "Sisu"
 fin_sisu_desc: "The harsh climate of the Finnish tundra has done little but steel our resolve to stand against those that wish to see us fall. The Swedes lay in the west and the Russian princes to the east. Yet we stand determined 'gainst the might and misery, for such is our lot."
 fin_war_retribution_title: "War of Retribution"
 fin_war_retribution_desc: "Once upon a time, we were colonized by our Swedish brethren, forced to pay taxes in money and men to finance the wars of the Danes. All of this political tomfoolery has gone on long enough. We will assert ourselves as the one and only Lion of the North."
 fin_finnish_them_off_title: "Finnish Them Off"
 fin_finnish_them_off_desc: "The conquest of Sweden has been swift and magnificent. It is time to bring this one-sided war to an end, finalizing our ambitions and bringing about a new era of Finnish domination in the north."
 
 # Missions, 3rd column
 fin_finnishization_title: "Finnishization"
 fin_finnishization_desc: "Perhaps the only legitimate city of Finland, Turku, rests on our southwestern shore, defending the mainland from Swedish raids. This issue cannot be more important; however, this is not the problem we face. Even with the Finnish majority concentrated in Turku, its vast Swedish population outweighs the Finnish by a landslide. Perhaps we can fix this..."
 fin_mend_karjala_title: "Mend Karjala"
 fin_mend_karjala_desc: "Upon the Schism lies our debacle, encrusted therein by circumstances. The people of Karjala have long since separated due to religious and political barriers enforced not by the people but by law. Law that we have denounced. The time has come to unite Karjala once and for all!"
 fin_finnish_nation_state_title: "The Finnish Nation-State"
 fin_finnish_nation_state_desc: "The realm of Finns has never stood as strong or valiant as now. Yet despite this glory, we find ourselves sorely lacking the proper grounds for a modern nation to rival those of Europe proper. We are the outcasts in the snowdrift, those who have made a place for themselves among the wastes. It is time to cement ourselves as one among the civilized world. We shall codify the numerous dialects of Finnish into one single language. All that remains is deciding the alphabet."
 
 # Missions, 4th column
 fin_alone_snowdrift_title: "Alone in the Snowdrift"
 fin_alone_snowdrift_desc: "'Neath the feet of powder lies a people hardened by centuries of hardship. Our cities are villages; our villages are hardly on the map. Yet we prosper in the barren wastes, for we are a people bound by something more powerful than language, culture, or ethnicity; we are people bound by necessity."
 fin_denounce_treaty_title: "Denounce the Treaty"
 fin_denounce_treaty_desc: "The renowned Treaty of Nöteborg supposedly represents a permanent peace between the Novgorodians and Swedes, at the same time marking the northern border between Catholicism and Orthodoxy. Outrageously, we Finns had no voice in establishing this treaty. Though it's a poor outcome, consequently, we need not abide by its stipulations. Let us disrupt the peace and push eastward to unite the Karelians once and for all."
 fin_rival_town_title: "The Rival Town"
 fin_rival_town_desc: "Viipuri is an integral center of trade and administration in our great northern light. Unfortunately, to the east lie the contentious merchants of Novgorod, steering trade from Finland to the shores of Karelia. Perhaps we can turn this dark tide."
 fin_supply_demand_title: "Supply and Demand"
 fin_supply_demand_desc: "With the intent to sell a product comes the insatiable appetite for more; more land, more supply, more furs. Our reliance on soft gold as both an export and a commodity has considerably boosted the economy. However, we have not achieved equilibrium. The people demand more."
 
 # Missions, 5th column
 fin_fringe_faithful_title: "Fringe of the Faithful"
 fin_fringe_faithful_desc: "We are at the edge of Catholicism, with our borders marking the borders of civilized Europe, or so we've been told. In truth, the Treaty of Nöteborg represents an arbitrary line enforced by missionaries, crusaders, and the kings of squabbling kingdoms. Upon our freedom lies the mantle of decision, the decision to choose our faith."
 fin_northern_beacon_title: "The Northern Beacon"
 fin_northern_beacon_desc: "The times of the Northern Crusades have long since passed, though their impact remains immeasurable. We stay devout to the Lord and all He stands for. Regardless of our allegiance to Rome, we might find solace in our love and loyalty to God."
 fin_baltic_dominance_title: "Baltic Dominance"
 fin_baltic_dominance_desc: "Finland has never been a nation of trade. We have little to offer aside from fur, and the Muscovites and Novgorodians far exceed our natural supply of the soft gold. Despite this, we can tip the scales. Our resurgence is nigh, and our prospects are high."

 # Events
 ME_Finland_Events.1.title: "The Sack of Neva"
 ME_Finland_Events.1.desc: "The merchants of Novgorod have long since stolen the rightful trade of Finland. Through a show of arms, we have proven our might to the Novgorodians; thus, to the victor go the spoils. The men have orders to spare the civilians to not tarnish our reputation. That aside, let anarchy ensue!"
 ME_Finland_Events.1.a: "A forthright occasion!"

 ME_Finland_Events.2.title: "Finnishization of Finland"
 ME_Finland_Events.2.desc: "Through decades of acclimation, the Swedish population of Abo gradually splintered from the Swedish Main. Slowly, they became indistinguishable from the Finns populating the area. Finnish has become the dominant language of our nation, with court documents across Karelia written in our mother tongue. As the Finnish culture spreads, we must make a point of representing our populace well. Only a glorious capital will do for our glorious nation."
 ME_Finland_Events.2.a: "Turku shall serve excellently in this regard."
 ME_Finland_Events.2.b: "$CAPITAL$ has untapped potential."

 ME_Finland_Events.3.title: "Integration of the Swedish"
 ME_Finland_Events.3.desc: "Despite our differences, the Swedes and Finns have coincided for centuries. We have worked towards prosperity even in the face of the Kalmar Union. Despite the differences our kingdoms might face, the peoples of Finland and Sweden have a history that none can forget."
 ME_Finland_Events.3.a: "We will be one nation."
 ME_Finland_Events.3.b: "We'll see about that..."

 ME_Finland_Events.3.hidden.title: "You should not be seeing this"
 ME_Finland_Events.3.hidden.desc: "WARNING!! WARNING!! PING VIELOR IN EMF DISCORD! THIS SHOULD NOT BE VISIBLE!"
 ME_Finland_Events.3.hidden.a: "If you can see this, clicking this won't do anything. Don't worry. You should be able to continue playing without problems."

 ME_Finland_Events.4.title: "The Finnish Union"
 ME_Finland_Events.4.desc: "The plague of the north, the Kalmar Union, has finally fallen. The Danes concede their right to rule Scandinavia, falling to our tremendous mettle and might. The fall of the Danes created a power vacuum in the region, one which we see fit to fill. A union must take the place of Kalmar, one dominated not by the Danes but by Finland. Our humble beginnings shall offer us insight into the flaws of our predecessors, bringing about an eternal empire of Finns."
 ME_Finland_Events.4.a: "The Finnish Union shall reign supreme!"
 ME_Finland_Events.4.b: "Finland we were, and so we shall remain."

 ME_Finland_Events.5.title: "Codification of the Finnish Language"
 ME_Finland_Events.5.desc: "Our rise to power has left little time to worry about the simple things in life. It is time to rectify our most significant flaw: that of linguistics. We must decide upon a proper alphabet to supplement the emerging and noble Finnish language and bring it to significance."
 ME_Finland_Events.5.a: "Use the Roman alphabet, like our Swedish brethren."
 ME_Finland_Events.5.b: "The Karelians use Cyrillic, and thus we shall too."
