 SCO_trade_title: "Lothian, a Trading Post"
 SCO_trade_desc: "Lothian, one of the most important trading posts in the North Sea, is our most prominent center where people from Cornwall to Trondelag come to trade. As the years have gone by, the amount of trade conducted has started to decline with the cities nearby becoming larger and larger. Therefore, we should improve the city's conditions to attract traders and merchants once more."
 SCO_land_development_title: "Land Development"
 SCO_land_development_desc: "Being to the immediate north of England, many people across our lands are living in terrible conditions because the cities are not large enough to contain them and they are limited to small houses scattered across the countryside. In England, the government has started to develop the provinces that they own to attract people and their methods have been working splendid. It is possible for us to gain even more benefit from copying their strategies and developing the lands."
 SCO_north_sea_trade_title: "North Sea Trade"
 SCO_north_sea_trade_desc: "Although it is overshadowed and dwarfed by the trade within the English Channel, the North Sea still receives trade from up in the Icelandic settlements and siphons some trade from Lubeck. As one of the larger powers of the node, we should be the dominant nation in the North Sea trading network to receive benefits for our trading economy."
 SCO_into_the_english_channel_title: "The English Channel"
 SCO_into_the_english_channel_desc: "The English Channel is the route of trade networks throughout the English Channel, from Brittany to Holland, as one of the more influential nodes. Not only is this one of the most valuable trading regions in the world, but it gives large economic benefit to any nation that has control over the channel. Thus, it would be logical for us to stake our claim by conquering and developing the lands to harbor new, large, burgeoning cities and establish our trading empire."
 SCO_world_trade_title: "World Trade"
 SCO_world_trade_desc: "In the entire world, the main trade regions that our nation lies within are very influential on the world spectre. The English Channel and the North Sea are some of the most valuable of these regions, containg many port and key inland cities such as London, Lothian, Amsterdam, Antwerp, and Dublin. Furthermore, if we were to control the aformentioned trade regions, then we can siphon trade into our own nation. We can easily make our home trade nodes the most valuable in the world - we merely need the power to do so."
 SCO_the_riches_of_south_africa_title: "Cape of Good Hope"
 SCO_the_riches_of_south_africa_desc: "In the 15th century, the Turkish Empire had blocked the Spice trade into Europe, and therefore left the great powers with a lack of spice and no known route to obtain it. However, the Portuguesr had decided to attempt to sail around Africa, and to the surprise of us, they had found a route across the Cape of Good Hope. Although treacherous, the journey provides access into the riches of the legendary Great Zimbabwe, India, and then the origin of spice - the East Indies. To control the trade in the Cape of Good Hope would channel it into the English Channel and our home, and would give us strategic benefit as a port where we can send trade from India."
 SCO_the_riches_of_india_title: "Indian Trade"
 SCO_the_riches_of_india_desc: "India is where much of the spice trade reaches as the South Indian merchants purchase it from the Spice Islands. The multiple strategic trade goods and trade regions would make a great addition within our realm and sphere of influence, from the gem mines in Golkonda to the large amounts of dyes and silk received from Chinese merchants and the East Indies inland. It would be in our greatest interests to dominate the trade in India to consolidate our trade power, and then move on to our next target - the Spice trade itself."
 SCO_the_riches_of_the_east_indies_title: "The East Indies"
 SCO_the_riches_of_the_east_indies_desc: "The East Indies are the lands east of India and south of China where many Muslim kingdoms are vying for power. This region is crucial to us, being where the Spice trade in itself is grown. These fair islands are what ship the trade goods into India, China, and Indochina, through the Straits of Malacca. Although owning Malacca to siphon trade from the straits is viable, we would be better off controlling the trade of most of the region to indirextly send to India or to the Cape to bring all these riches to our homeland."
 SCO_gaelic_title:"Cultural Revolution"
 SCO_gaelic_desc: "In the northern parts of our nation and in the subjects of the Isles, the Highlander culture runs free and the golden era of their culture has started to being. As a distinctively not English nation, we are of Scottish culture but are ultimately limited to some basic differences between us and the English. In order to truly call ourselves a distinct culture from the English, then we need to start vying to move on to a new culture that is not similar to the people we despise - but an entirely new cultural group - the Highlanders."
 SCO_easter_egg_title:0 "Dahomey in the House"
 SCO_easter_egg_desc:0 "Our vassal Tyrone needs a homie - but Dahomey is all the way in Africa. Let us subjugate them so they can be homies again."
 SCO_scottish_marches_title: "The Scottish Marches"
 SCO_scottish_marches_desc: "The Scottish Marches are a historical border region between our people and the English, and Hadrian's wall, although not exactly near the border, is still a line of defense that our nation proceeds to use. Not only are the Scottish Marches a state that is split between our two nations, but it is also a strategic location within our trade region. Moreover, Northumberland is still a key port and centered fort that was strategically placed and is still problematic to anyone who tries to siege it. We must conquer the rest of the Scottish Marches and start to dominate the English like they once attempted to do to us."
 SCO_yorkshire_title: "Yorkshire"
 SCO_yorkshire_desc: "The Yorkshire region is an area rich with history from the Romans to the Vikings and the English and the Saxons in between. In particular, the city of York is in our particular interests due to the amount of strategic importance within the North Sea trade region and the historical growth it has shown. York was an ancient Roman city dating back to 2000 years, but in the last 600 years has grown tremendously, especially under the Danes who made it the Danelaw's most important city. With the amount of trade and military benefit we would receive from owning Yorkshire, we should rally the troops and declare war on their owners immediately."
 SCO_the_isles_title: "The Isles"
 SCO_the_isles_desc: "Historically, the Isles were a diplomatically tied state that claimed the islands east of our nation and were always aligned with us in many situations. After a while, being threatened by other nations led them to agree to become a vassal state under our rule. Now, after all this time, we need to expand our borders with the looming threat of the Danes and english. Hence, we should try to integrate our loyal vassal the Isles to have direct control over their lands and use their lands for our needs."
 SCO_ulster_title: "Ulaidh"
 SCO_ulster_desc: "The Northern areas of Ireland are across the straits, seperated from our nation by only the Irish Sea, but our brethren in culture. The English are starting to push on Ireland and enforce their language, culture, and traditions on them to undermine their cultural ties to us. This is problematic, as our Irish brothers are the last ones we have after the English were conquered by the Normans. As a rival of England, we are obligated to diplomatically integrate the lands into our nation to prevent them from falling under England; starting with the lands of Ulaidh."
 SCO_nibbas_title: "Tir Eoghain"
 SCO_nibbas_desc: "As we start our subjugation of Ireland to 'liberate our brethren' from the English, we have started to fabricate legitimate claims on Tyrone, and the lands of Tir Eoghain along with it. The next potential target, they are weak and are under threat by our rivals, so we might be able to do this diplomatically. However, if it comes to it, we must do this by force, or the Irish people will be no more, and our rivals will take the lands and wipe the Irish culture off the face of the map."
 SCO_tyrconnell_title: "Tyrconell"
 SCO_tyrconnell_desc: "The subjugation of Ireland is a long and treacherous route that will lead us to our largest end goal - to conquer and control all of Britannia - by preventing our southern neighbors from expanding inland using the Pale. As we have started with the Irish minors across the coast, we have reached the point where we do not have time to move one by one across the Emerald Isle, and after we take Tyrconell we will start taking regions as fast as possible. We can not let the English expand into Northern Ireland, our Lothian is next."
 SCO_connacht_title: "Connacht"
 SCO_connacht_desc: "When we integrated Tyrconell into our nation, we came to the realization that we can no longer maintain our slow policy of diplomatically vassalizing each and every nation that claims every piece of land in Ireland. With the English starting to grow weak, they are starting to set their sights toward Ireland and as a spring board directly to our nation. Now, we must start annexing swathes of land into the [Root.Get.Adjective] lands, with our sights being set on Connacht, and around the Pale into Munster next."
 SCO_munster_title: "Munster"
 SCO_munster_desc: "After integrating and assimilating the area of Connacht into our empire, we planned on meandering around the Pale (Dublin/Meath) and into Munster, to surround them. Whilst the English are attempting to get East Ireland on their side, the rivalries between the minors will allow us to conquer Munster with ease and start to spread our wings across the Isles and soon claim our rightful as the dominant power within the English Channel, and then the world."
 SCO_west_midlands_title: "The West Midlands"
 SCO_west_midlands_desc: "The West and East Midlands are the areas that are exactly of what their name suggests - the midlands between the northern Scottish Marches and to the fertile arable lands of Wessex and the deep south. With the west leading into Wales and the East leading into East Anglia, it is imperative to conquer it all, but we shall start with the west."
 SCO_east_midlands_title: "The Eastern Midlands"
 SCO_east_midlands_desc: "With the West Midlands conquered and integrated into our nation the next sight we set our view on is the East, the gateway into East Anglia and the English heartland of Wessex and their large city of Westminster, the largest on the Isles. The gateway to Wales, our brothers, and the restoration of the Celtic culture is almost in place!"
 SCO_wales_conquests_title: The Welsh State"
 SCO_wales_conquests_desc: "The only mainland English-occupied lands of our brothers - long been under the rule of the English, are fading away as the days go by. The Welsh culture in itself, the only Celtic culture left in Great Britain, is starting to become assimilated into the English culture and is being culturally genocided. The land is in our interests, and we have to continue to 'liberate our brothers', and to free the Welsh state from outside rule would severely help us threaten England's legitimacy and become the dominant power in Britannia."

Now, they have even gotten the audacity to start threatening war over lands, and are demanding that we cede to them the Isle of Man. This can largely be a problem to us, and we must take the route that will do the most benefit."
