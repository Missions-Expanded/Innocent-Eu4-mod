 ME_Ayyubid_Events.1.d: "By Allah's grace, on this blessed day, the Ayyubids once again enter what's their divine right - the city of Halab. The Ayyubid banners once again proudly flies on the magnificient walls of the city, inciting pride for all of our brave soldiers. While this is not a formal annexation, it is a milestone in restoring what's ours."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.1.a: "Halab will be liberated!"

 ME_Ayyubid_Events.2.t: "Ayyubids in Damascus"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.2.d: "The glorious Ayyubid soldiers once more walk on the soil of Damascus. Sadly, the parade of our forces is not met with as much cheer as it should be, for the local citezenry hadn't experienced Ayyubid prosperity for almost two centuries now. While they might be disgraceful now, they will be grateful for what the prosperity city will experience upon our inevitable conquest. "
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.2.a: "Damascus will be ours!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.3.t: "Rule Restored over Syria"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.3.d: "From the busied burghers, bustling about in Aleppo, to the fickle fiends of Dimashq, our banner soars brightly, shining as not only our guiding star, but as our monument to victory, to glory; it gallantly gallops to and fro', a testament to the tenacity of man. What falls shall rise once more. So easily one forgets of beauty; it leaves the mind as it leaves the earth. The azure rumblings of the waves shall reach these shores once more, for the sea once again has reason to rise and fall. The pitiful, vile, conniving slaves made haste to their downfall; for this we might thank the Lord. Needn't the people of Syria worry again, for we have returned to this seemingly barren land; of course, the naked eye sees not what is despises. A happy people, a fruitful people, resides upon these rolling dunes, prepared to celebrate the triumphant return of its lord."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.3.a: "Syria shall prosper again!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.4.t: "Rule Restored over Palestine"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.4.d: "It is hard to grasp how in these valleys, centuries ago had the muslims fought christian invaders.

 ME_Ayyubid_Events.4.a: "The Ayyubids shall feast on Horns of Hattin again!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.5.t: "Rule Restored over Egypt"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.5.d: "It was in these humble streets of Egyptian Cities that the great Saladin once had begun his career as a powerful figure. Firstly, a minor figurehead in Egypt, he rose to power and managed to defeat his former overlords, establishing a formal sultanate. Egypt, in conjuction with Syria, was one of his most prosperous provinces in the state. We can be sure, that Saladin is watching us from the heavens, proud of us reclaiming his legacy."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.5.a: "Saladin would be proud."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.6.t: "Sharifate of Mecca"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.6.d: "The descendants of Hasan ibn Ali have been ruling the Holy Cities for centuries now. It cannot be said that the rule was sovereign though, for many have subjugated the sharifate and the current Sharif cannot be trusted to stay independant from others. Due to this, it might be better for everyone if we were the ones to control the Holy Cities, either directly or indirectly, via controlling the Sharif. And so we did conquer the Holy Cities, but is it a wise decision to restore the sharifate, or to protect the cities directly?"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.6.a: "We shall not disturb the Sharifate."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.6.b: "Direct control is ideal."

In our quest to preserve the Caliphate by capturing the Caliph and claiming the Caliphate we put hope. But it appears that we are not the sole originators of the idea. The Ottomans seem to have the same plan, as they captured the Caliph, who is now residing in their capital."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.7.a: "Grave news! We need to focus our attention elsewhere."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.8.t: "Ayyubid Capture of the Abbasid Caliph"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.8.d: "The Abbasid Caliph, who has been tormented by foreign powers as a marionette for decades now, has finally been liberated from the foreign shackles.

 ME_Ayyubid_Events.8.a: "Marvelous!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.9.t: "Ayyubids in Cairo"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.9.d: "The Mamluks Sultanate has entered a period of Decadence, in which all of their nation is crumbling apart. In this collapse lies the city of Cairo, which is the greatest amongst its kind. What great city deserves to be under a decadent ruler? As such, by the blessing of Allah, the Ayyubid golden banner once again flies in Cairo, bestowing a new period of prosperity upon the city."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.9.a: "Very Well."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.10.t: "The Northern Frontier"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.10.d: "On our northern border lies the Ottoman Empire and other various tribes that often put raids on our lands. And while the tribes put up a fierce fight - they are no match for our disciplined armies and their raids are usually insignificant. Meanwhile, there is also the Ottoman threat, formally we are not hostile, a possiblity of their invasion is real, and cannot be ignored. What should the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] do?"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.10.a: "We need to strengthen defenses"

 ME_Ayyubid_Events.11.t: "Funding the Al-Firdaws Madrasa"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.11.d: "Al-Firdaws Madrasa is the most famous of Ayyubid buildings in the vicinity of Halab. A great feat of architecture, the madrasa consists of several parts which were expanded upon the years by the successive patrons of the complex. Now, it is once again the Ayyubid Dynasty that holds the institution, and we have a choice to expand this famous school."

 ME_Ayyubid_Events.12.t: "The Expansion and Growth of Hisn Kayfa"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.12.d: "Such is the nature of conquest, that the conqueror influences the conquered. As a result of the growth of our [Root.Country.GetTitle], massive amounts of immigrants are entering our city, boosting its population and fame. Great times are ahead for [4295.Province.GetName]."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.12.a: "We'll give them a warm welcome."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.13.t: "Saladin Mausoleum"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.13.d: "The remnants of Saladin lie here. He was a ruler who, despite perishing centuries ago, is still influencing the way kings rule their kingdoms. His mausoleum is still visited in great numbers to this day, despite requiring a long travel for some. But, as the descendants of Saladin, we ought to give him a proper mausoleum, one worthy of such a virtous man. The only question remains, can we afford to further improve the Mausoleum?"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.13.a: "Spare no expenses!"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.13.b: "We have to turn our focus elsewhere."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.14.t: "The Ayyubid Caliphate"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.14.d: "Through careful moves and actions, we have managed to do what we thought was unachievable. We have managed to lay a claim to the title of Caliph, and our claim is now universally accepted as legitimate. Would Saladin have considered that his descendants would come to lead the Muslim World? What the answer may be, we shall never know, but shall know, that with the new title come new responsibilities that we have obliged to do."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.14.a: "We lived in times blessed by Allah!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.15.t: "End of Crusader Age"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.15.d: "It was in the 1095 that the first crusade began which started several centuries of war and bloodshed in the Middle East. Happily, we can enjoy peace now, for [Root.Country.GetName] finally achieved the goal of repelling the christians and quelling down the conflicts by his victory over the last crusader states. It is the end of the Crusader Age, and the inhibitants of so-called 'Holy Land' may live in peace once more."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.15.a: "Jerusalem is staying in Muslim Hands!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.16.t: "The Mokha Empire"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.16.d: "Since time immemorial, Yemeni coffee has remained in Yemen. The great bushes of Mokha remained a state secret, guarded as a priceless treasure. We are not a greedy people. This product should be distributed across our wide empire, free to all willing to purchase it. The bushes, however, can stay where they are."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.16.a: "Let them drink coffee!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.17.t: "New Traditions & Ambitions"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.17.d: "Our state is going through a range of changes that is rapidly changing our identity and ideals. Unless we actively work against it we will see the ambitions and traditions of our country change as a result of this."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.17.a: "Yes, Please!"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.17.b: "No, we cannot abandon our roots."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.18.t: "Piety of the ruler"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.18.d: "Each ruler treats the faith in a different way. Some show great acts of faith, some watch in the shadows, living a life that can be considered heretical by some. Whatever the case may be, we must decide, if our state wills to live in great piety, or would it rather succumb itself to the Mystic ways?"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.18.a: "Legalism is the key!"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.18.b: "Balance will bring us closest to the Allah."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.18.c: "Mysticism is the only way."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.19.t: "Question of the Mamluk Corps"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.19.d: "Mamluks were corps of slave soldiers initially conceived by the Abbasid Caliph, al-Ma'mun. They gradually rose in power, ultimately taking over Egypt in 1261, when they created a sultanate of their own which had the Caliph only as a religious figure. Their regiments have fantastic courage and power, but if they rise to power too much, they may become a problem to us. Perhaps the pros outweigh the cons, and they should be brought back? "
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.19.a: "By all means, bring them back!"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.19.b: "They betrayed once, they shall betray no longer."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.20.t: "Attempted Mamluk Coup"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.20.d: "Noone could've predicted a century ago, that the reestablished Mamluk corps would once again rise to such power, that they would be able to attempt a coup. But alas, they rose to power and so an attempted coup they tried to make. Happily, their leader was stopped in time, for we would be ruled by a Mamluk ruler instead of the rightful [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In spite of this, Mamluks have to be disestablished, which will put our country in turmoil for some time."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.20.a: "Horrible News."
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.21.t: "Scholars of Ayyubids"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.21.d: "The cooperations of scholars all over the [Root.Country.GetTitle] have resulted in development of cutting-edge technologies and ways. With such support of the scholars, our country is up to a bright future."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.21.a: "We owe them much!"
 
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.22.t: "Cities of the Empire"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.22.d: "The rapid expansion of the state has resulted in a dilemma. In the past, Ayyubid capital would change depending on the policy the current ruler, which would seldom result in the capital switching from Cairo to Damascus.  In this age, we have been more savvy with moving the capital, but we have to consider if it wouldn't benefit us much greater to have the capital in the great old cities of Damascus or Cairo."
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.22.a: "Our Capital shall lie in Cairo!"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.22.b: "Damascus suits us best!"
 ME_Ayyubid_Events.22.c: "Monarch shall stay where he is!"
