 ME_Bavaria_Events.EVTNAME2: "The Oktoberfest"
 ME_Bavaria_Events.EVTDESC2: "Crown Prince Ludwig, later King Ludwig I, married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen on 12 October 1810. The citizens of Munich were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the royal event. The fields were named Theresienwiese ("Theresa's Meadow") in honour of the Crown Princess. Horse races, in the tradition of the 15th-century Scarlet Race, were held on 18 October to honor the newlyweds. The precise origins of the festival and horse races remain a matter of controversy. However, the decision to repeat the horse races, spectacle, and celebrations in 1811 launched what is now the annual Oktoberfest tradition."
 ME_Bavaria_Events2.EVTOPT1: "Wonderful."

 ME_Bavaria_Events.EVTNAME3: "Münchner Reinheitsgebot"
 ME_Bavaria_Events.EVTDESC3: ""We hereby proclaim and decree, by Authority of our Province, that henceforth in the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName], in the country as well as in the cities and marketplaces, the following rules apply to the sale of beer: \nFrom Michaelmas to Georgi, the price for one Mass or one Kopf , is not to exceed one Pfennig [Root.Capital.GetName] value, and \nFrom Georgi to Michaelmas, the Mass shall not be sold for more than two Pfennig of the same value, the Kopf not more than three Heller. \nIf this not be adhered to, the punishment stated below shall be administered. \nShould any person brew, or otherwise have, other beer than March beer, it is not to be sold any higher than one Pfennig per Mass. \nFurthermore, we wish to emphasize that in the future in all cities, market-towns and in the country, the only ingredients used for the brewing of beer must be Barley, Hops and Water. Whosoever knowingly disregards or transgresses upon this ordinance, shall be punished by the Court authorities' confiscating such barrels of beer, without fail. \nShould, however, an innkeeper in the country, city or market-towns buy two or three pails of beer and sell it again to the common peasantry, he alone shall be permitted to charge one Heller more for the Mass or the Kopf, than mentioned above. Furthermore, should there arise a scarcity and subsequent price increase of the barley, WE, the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName], shall have the right to order curtailments for the good of all concerned." \n\nThe law was first adopted in the Duchy of Munich in 1487. After Bavaria was reunited, the Munich law was adopted across the entirety of Bavaria on 23 April 1516. This law set the price of beer (depending on the time of year and type of beer), limited the profits made by innkeepers, and made confiscation the penalty for making impure beer."

[From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will give us a noble gift... it only has a small catch: If we accept the generous gift, we need to swear allegiance to them. On the other hand, the people like the [From.GetAdjective]s, so this shouldn't do any harm, right?"

 ME_Bavaria_Events.EVTDESC11: "The dynasty [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], from [From.GetName], has increased its power dramatically within the last decades.
