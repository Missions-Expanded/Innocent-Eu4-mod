 ME_Poland_Events.1.t: "Incorporation of Rawa and Belz to the Crown"
 ME_Poland_Events.1.d: "In 1462, as a result of the tragic death of the reigning Duke of Mazovia, the Polish Crown has incorporated the territories of Rawa and Belz into the Kingdom. Attempts were made to incorporate the state fully, but the keen politics and the opposition of the Mazovian Nobility has successfully prevented that from happening."
 ME_Poland_Events.1.a: "Splendid."
 ME_Poland_Events.1.b: "We cannot risk to displease the Mazovian Dukes!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.2.t: "Founding of Zamosc"
 ME_Poland_Events.2.d: "Zamosc, Padua of the North, Pearl of the Renaissance, was a city founded by Jan Zamoyski, one of the most important political figures and magnates in the Commonwealth of his time. The city was built from scratch and was meant to be both functional, and as a splendid residence of the Zamoyski family. The city was built as per the ideals of Renaissance architecture, with some solutions introduced based on its unique location."
 ME_Poland_Events.2.a: "While he may be rich, he could use more funds for sure!"
 ME_Poland_Events.2.b: "Great news to hear!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.3.t: "To Support a Holy War"
 ME_Poland_Events.3.d: "Our legate in Poland has been hard at work protecting the interests of the Christendom in the East. Among the topics that have been recently tackled would be a holy war against the tatars on the peripheries of catholicism. Should we send them funds?"
 ME_Poland_Events.3.a: "Support Them!"
 ME_Poland_Events.3.b: "Papacy cannot afford any expenditures"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.4.t: "Papal Support"
 ME_Poland_Events.4.d: "Papal State has pledged us funds, should we go to war with the vile heathen Tatars in the future. They also agreed to send more benefits when the war has begun."
 ME_Poland_Events.4.a: "Wonderful!"

 ME_Poland_Events.5.t: "Delivering on the Promise"
 ME_Poland_Events.5.d: "We have promised to pledge additional funds to Poland, should they actually follow up with a war against the Tatars. So they did, and now it is time we uphold our promise."
 ME_Poland_Events.5.a: "For Christendom!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.6.t: "Moldavia Secured"
 ME_Poland_Events.6.d: "Our campaigning to the south has finally borne fruit. Through keen political manuevering, we were able to get hold of the Moldavian Principality. With the voivode's loyalty, our gates to the Black Sea lay open."
 ME_Poland_Events.6.a: "A stepping stone to Carogród for sure."
 ME_Poland_Events.6.b: "We are here merely for the profits."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.7.t: "Lisowczycy"
 ME_Poland_Events.7.d: "Lisowczycy was the name of a mercenary contingent mainly in employ across Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Also called Stracency which translates into 'Lost Men' or 'Forlorn Hope', were an extremely fierce company, which lead to them being effective in battle, but also very troublesome elsewhere."
 ME_Poland_Events.7.a: "Let us put them into employ!"
 ME_Poland_Events.7.b: "Troublemakers! Send them somewhere else..."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.8.t: "An Heir Needed in Bohemia"
 ME_Poland_Events.8.d: "Many of the nobles in Bohemia are willing to support the Jagiellonians on the Czech Throne. There are also many more which would also back this noble cause... for some other benefits of course."
 ME_Poland_Events.8.a: "Shower them in money."
 ME_Poland_Events.8.b: "Send our own men to help them out."
 ME_Poland_Events.8.c: "They can join us, if they want."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.9.t: "Transfer of Silesia"
 ME_Poland_Events.9.d: "Silesia has long-since splintered into many smaller counties, disunited and in vassalage to Bohemia or to the Polish Crown. Now with the seizure of the Bohemian Throne by the Polish Jagiellonians, it is time to bring an end to the disunity and to transfer those territories back into Polish fold."
 ME_Poland_Events.9.a: "An Excellent Proposal!"
 ME_Poland_Events.9.b: "This would make it messier than it already is."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.10.t: "The Senat"
 ME_Poland_Events.10.d: "Rada Królewska (Curia Regis, King's Court, Royal Council) was an insitution in Poland that was mainly an advisory body to the King. In the late 15th century it slowly began transforming itself into the Senat, the upper house of the Polish Parliament until the country's dissolution in 1795. The Senat was mainly controlled by the Polish Nobles, but other estates also had a say, such as the clerical Bishops."
 ME_Poland_Events.10.a: "Confirm current privileges"
 ME_Poland_Events.10.b: "Let us not let the estates get too influential"
 ME_Poland_Events.10.c: "Grant additional privileges"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.11.t: "Growth of National Industry"
 ME_Poland_Events.11.d: "Currently the majority of polish industry is comprised of artisans producing all kinds of textile-related products. Much of this is exported outwards, making our textiles well-known abroad. For those hearing about the polish splendor and power, curiosity guides them towards our borders. With those people come skilled workers, capable of bringing new industries to the towns."
 ME_Poland_Events.11.a: "Poland can prosper too!"
 ME_Poland_Events.11.b: "The old textile trade has never failed us."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.12.t: "A Puppet King"
 ME_Poland_Events.12.d: "The Jagiellonian kin in Hungary is weak and is being manipulated by the local nobles, wealthy or not. If we don't do anything about this, our hold over Hungary might grow weaker, and the noble rule in Hungary may continue to grow."
 ME_Poland_Events.12.a: "We won't allow him to be deceived!"
 ME_Poland_Events.12.b: "We need not meddle in their affairs, as long as they recognize our rule, of course."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.13.t: "A Chance of Remedy"
 ME_Poland_Events.13.d: "The tragic loss at Battle of Varna brought an end to the last crusade against the Ottomans. As horrible as the defeat may have been, the Polish Jagiellonians did not lose spirit, for they are back again trying to halt the Turkish Expansion into Europe. Question is, will we, the representatives of God on Earth, help them?"
 ME_Poland_Events.13.a: "We will help financially..."
 ME_Poland_Events.13.b: "The armies of [Root.GetName] will strike fear in the Janissaries!"
 ME_Poland_Events.13.c: "Hmm..."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.14.t: "Revenge for Varna"
 ME_Poland_Events.14.d: "The Varna Crusade has seen grave loss in the ranks of our Kings. King Vladislav, a fellow servant to the Holy Lord in Heaven, whose tragic death marked the end of the crusade, must be avenged. And is it not a joy that such vengeance is being done, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] has declared war on the Osmans, wishing to halt their expansion into Europe."
 ME_Poland_Events.14.a: "Request all help!"
 ME_Poland_Events.14.b: "We can do it all by ourselves."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.15.t: "Conversion to [Owner.Culture.GetName]"
 ME_Poland_Events.15.d: "Thanks to our keen policies of peaceful settlement and migrations, the [Owner.Culture.GetName] nobles and other estates are moving into the area of [Root.GetName]. This is causing the current population to slowly mix with the arriving immigrants and to slowly assimilate into our culture."
 ME_Poland_Events.15.a: "Excellent."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.16.t: "Work of Mikolaj Rej"
 ME_Poland_Events.16.d: "Born 1505 in Zurawno near Halicz, Mikolaj Rej is often called the Father of Polish Literature. A talented writer and translator, he managed to get favors of the King himself, who gifted him property for his servitude to the country. Even though Mikolaj knew the latin language, he was a promoter of creating in the Polish language, as opposed to many others of his time."
 ME_Poland_Events.16.a: "'The Polish are not geese, for they have their own language.'"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.17.t: "Jan Kochanowski"
 ME_Poland_Events.17.d: "Born 25 years after Mikolaj Rej, Jan Kochanowski is widely regarded as be the greatest poet of the first Rzeczpospolita. Of his work, the most famous has to be the cycle of Threnodies, dedicated to his daughter, Urszula, who died in infancy. Other notable work includes the play 'Dismissal of Greek Envoys', the 'Fraszki' cycle, 'Dawid's Psalter' and 'Piesni'."
 ME_Poland_Events.17.a: "An Excellent Creator!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.18.t: "Growth of the Sicz"
 ME_Poland_Events.18.d: "With the policies of the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, the Zaporozhian sich seems to only grow. More and more Ruthenian peasants, displeased by the catholic noblemen, flees to the wild fields and become a part of the Cossack brotherhood, bolstering their ranks. Perhaps it is time to give those rowdy group more autonomy to represent their truly unique relationship with our Monarchy."
 ME_Poland_Events.18.a: "Very Well, grant them autonomy!"
 ME_Poland_Events.18.b: "Cossack Register is enough."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.19.t: "Skarb Rawski"
 ME_Poland_Events.19.d: "Wojsko Kwarciane (quarter army) is the name given to the army units of the Commonwealth in the second half of the 16th century. Their origins stem from the Obrona Potoczna, who were permanent units tasked with defense of the state from foreign raids. The name of the army comes from the Quarter Tax, which was used to pay for their upkeep. The war chest for this purpose was stored in the castle in Rawa Mazowiecka."
 ME_Poland_Events.19.a: "Wonderful"

 ME_Poland_Events.20.t: "Order of the White Eagle"
 ME_Poland_Events.20.d: "Order Orla Bialego - Order of the White Eagle - was founded by his majesty, King August II the Strong, in November of 1705. Initially given to loyalists of the King, it would lose its prestige soonafter due to its value being debased by the ever-present selling of the title by the King's minister." #TODO: rewrite later
 ME_Poland_Events.20.a: "Those who show their bravery will be awarded."
 ME_Poland_Events.20.b: "Only those meritable shall receive it!"
 ME_Poland_Events.20.c: "I sense a business opportunity..."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.21.t: "Warsaw Confederation"
 ME_Poland_Events.21.d: "Following the Warsaw Confederation, an act granting Religious Freedoms, a peace of religious peace ensued. While many of the Western European states were embroiled in bloody religous conflicts, Poland stood tall as the bastion of tolerance. This has attracted many religious minorities, including the German Protestants, who settled in Prussia, both Royal and Ducal, and Polish Brethren, who were part of the Minor Reformed Church of Poland."
 ME_Poland_Events.21.a: "We welcome thee!"
 ME_Poland_Events.21.b: "A good development for sure."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.22.t: "[Root.GetName] Accepts the Pope!"
 ME_Poland_Events.22.d: "As per the Union of Brest, the ortodox church is welcome to accept Pope as their suzerain and continue practicing their own liturgy. Despite this noble offer of schism amendment, many orthodox christians still oppose the issue. Thankfully, the Lord has gifted those in [Root.GetName] true piety, for they stood out and embraced the Grecocatholic faith."
 ME_Poland_Events.22.a: "Wonderful!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.23.t: "Fierce Resistance in [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Poland_Events.23.d: "Unfortunately, those in [Root.GetName] still oppose our pious union, stubborn to be on the wrong side of the schism... Hopefully the God will enlighten them of their misdeeds. For now, we will have to live with their attitude."
 ME_Poland_Events.23.a: "Continue our efforts." 
 ME_Poland_Events.23.b: "They'll learn to love us in no time!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.24.t: "[Root.GetName] Resists Our Policies"
 ME_Poland_Events.24.d: "The orthodox population in [Root.GetName] is not all that happy with our methods. To  say that they dislike the idea of recognizing pope as their spiritual leader is to put it lightly. As a result, the orthodox peasantry began migration to their height of possibilities."
 ME_Poland_Events.24.a: "Typical naysayers... Good riddance!"
 ME_Poland_Events.24.b: "We can talk..."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.26.t: "Union of Brest"
 ME_Poland_Events.26.d: "The Ruthenian Uniate Church established as a result of the Union of Brest. Since its creation, it spurred controversy among the Ruthenian population, which viewed it as an act of Catholicization and Polonization. The main difference between the Orthodox and Uniate churches was the fact, that, while the latter recognized the Pope as their spiritual leader, the former did not."
 ME_Poland_Events.26.a: "A Brilliant Development!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.27.t: "Migration of the Sicz"
 ME_Poland_Events.27.d: "The Zaporozhian Cossacks originally fled to the borderlands due to their desolation, but due to our expansionist policy, the borderlands are not quite on the border anymore, which has put the Sich in a weird situation."
 ME_Poland_Events.27.a: "Facilitate their Migration."
 ME_Poland_Events.27.b: "It's the end of the sicz!"
 
 ME_Poland_Events.28.t: "Tadeusz Kosciuszko"
 ME_Poland_Events.28.d: "Tadeusz Kosciuszko is one of the national heroes of not just Poland, but also United States and Belarus. Born in Mereczowszczyzna in 1746, he was ambitious and thanks to the support of Czarnecki family, he was able to study in the famed Corps of Cadets (Szkola Rycerska). He is known for his contribution to the American Independence War and his insurrection against the powers who were trying to have the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth fully annexed. Much could be said about the valour of this man."
 ME_Poland_Events.28.a: "This man will lead our armies!"
 ME_Poland_Events.28.b: "Under his management, our troops will know true drill."
 
 ME_Poland_Events.31.t: "Jagiellons in Kremlin"
 ME_Poland_Events.31.d: "In the early 17th century, during the Russian Time of Troubles, the Polish army was able to capture and occupy Moscow. During the war, candidacy of the Polish King's Son, Wladyslaw, was put forward. Popular among the pro-polish boyars, Poles were let back into the city, where boyars hoped Wladyslaw would convert to Orthodoxy and grant them privileges. This compromise did not appease King Sigismund however, who decided to seize the throne himself and to convert Russia to Roman Catholicism. That made him quite unpopular, and the polish garrison would soon be ousted thereafter."

 ME_Poland_Events.32.d: "For the purposes of the Thirteen Years' War, the Polish-Lithuanian alliance has rented out a fleet of privateers to fight for them against the Teutonic Knights. That event proved to be quite beneficial, as the hired navy scored a victory against the Order in the Battle of Vistula Lagoon, weakening the enemy supply lines and depriving the garrison in Marienburg of morale."

 ME_Poland_Events.36.d: "Thanks to our keen policies of peaceful settlement and migrations, the [Owner.Culture.GetName] nobles and other estates are moving into the area of [Root.GetName].

 ME_Poland_Events.37.d: "In 1003, the King Boleslaw the Brave has seized the opportunity and invaded the Kingdom of Bohemia, who was at the time in great unrest. Upon the conquest, he declared himself the King of Bohemia. Unfortunately, due to his policy of looting, he was deeply disliked among the Czech Nobility, who incited a rebellion in Prague and deposed Boleslaw year after. This time will be different. This time [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be crowned, and he will be crowned with support and everlasting loyalty of the Bohemian nobles!"
 ME_Poland_Events.37.a: "Let [Root.Monarch.GetName] Be Crowned!"
