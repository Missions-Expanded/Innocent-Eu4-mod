 BRA_renaissance_title: "Arrival of Renaissance"
 BRA_renaissance_desc: "The Renaissance, a movement originating from Italy in the 15th century, has not passed by the marches. At the end of the 15th century, the margraves of Brandenburg have begun to pursue a state ruled by law and humanism. As a result, elector Joachim the First has founded Universita Viadrina in 1506. Having also strengthened the rights of the 'Kammergericht' ten years later and instituted the Constitutio Joachimica in 1527, elector Joachim I has established himself as the initiator of renaissance in Brandenburg."
 BRA_privy_council_title: "Privy Council"
 BRA_privy_council_desc: "Our nation requires a more subtle touch compared to the typical council of advisors. A discrete board of the [Root.Monarch.Title]'s closest advisors--the duchy's best and brightest--will ensure that state affairs are handled with efficiency and efficacy."
 BRA_hohenzollerns_in_franconia_title: "Franconian Relatives"
 BRA_hohenzollerns_in_franconia_desc: "Over in the poorish lands of Ansbach lay our dynastic brethren. House Hohenzollern stretches far and wide, though its sure grip on Ansbach presents an opportunity to unite the clans of the House into one unified political entity, if not geographical."
 BRA_hohenzollern_domination_title: "Hohenzollern Domination"
 BRA_hohenzollern_domination_desc: "The prestigious Hohenzollern Dynasty boasts historic claims to the German lands of Franconia, ruling over several counties in the region. For the glory of the House of Hohzenzollern, we should unite the region under the true German crown, the crown that has ruled Brandenburg dutifully for these few decades."
 BRA_neumark_title: "Treaty of Cölln"
 BRA_neumark_desc: "The New Mark of Brandenburg lays in the hands of the militant Prussians. Thankfully, their virulent wars and financial mismanagement give us an opening. We expect that they might simply pawn off the territory to its rightful owners. Should they fail to do so, the Emperor should condone a rightful conquest of the area. The Margraviate shall grow, one way or another."
 BRA_pomerania_title: "Subdue Pommern"
 BRA_pomerania_desc: "Centuries of bitter warfare with the Northern fiends of Pomerania leave us poor whilst they thrive on ill-gotten gains. As they spit upon our name, we have suffered greatly both in honor and dignity. It is our duty to put an end to this northward violence and turmoil. There shall be no escape this time."
 BRA_mecklenburg_title: "End the Hansetage"
 BRA_mecklenburg_desc: "The influence of the Hanseatic League stretches from the far reaches of the Lowlands to the merchants of Riga, all the way inland to our neighbors in Magdeburg. Whilst the alliance is defensive in nature, it presents a threat to the well-being to the Margraviate, both economically and militarily. A threat to even the mighty Kalmar Union, we cannot rest easy while such an influential organization of city-states sleeps next to us."
 BRA_winds_of_reformation_title: "Winds of Reformation"
 BRA_winds_of_reformation_desc: "Long have we toiled under the inquisitive Roman church, sending extortionate dues in the form of tithes. Our brothers and sisters across the Empire throw off the shackles of Rome as we speak. It is our duty as proud Christians to join them in their righteous endeavor of pure faith. The posturing priests of Catholicism know not of the plight of the common man, nor what is right in the eyes of the Lord. Let a man decide on his own his path to salvation; let him read the Good Book!"
 BRA_religious_unity_title: "Cuius Regio Eius Religio"
 BRA_religious_unity_desc: "'Whose Realm, Their Religion.' It is the duty of ruler to determine the path their citizenry must follow, both in earthly matters and those beyond comprehension. A single man cannot sit above the Holy See and know of salvation for each man, woman, and child. A decentralized church is best for all except the Pope, and to that end we shall enforce a new way--a better way. A Brandenburgian way."
 BRA_dominance_in_the_circle_title: "Electoral Dominance"
 BRA_dominance_in_the_circle_desc: "The Saxons represent a militant faction both among the Electors and the Empire as a whole. Though our history with the Duchy has been more or less peaceful, it has been tense at best. And as they say, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. We cannot be unprepared in the event that this fragile armistice shatters."
 BRA_fate_of_saxony_title: "Fate of Saxony"
 BRA_fate_of_saxony_desc: "We are no strangers to war, nor are the Saxons. They know the rules, and so do we. This fact, however, need not lead to bloodshed. Should we recognize them as brothers and kin, we might yet reach a diplomatic solution. We could represent a fearsome coalition, both in battle and in the Imperial elections, which we hope to one day secure. However, should the need arise, warfare is always a solid backup plan."
 BRA_prussia_title: "Herzogtum Preußen"
 BRA_prussia_desc: "The Hohenzollern Dynasty has always had close ties to the Prussians. Despite our disdain of the Teutons, they are their own worst enemy; indeed, they shall fall in due time. A posthumous duchy shall arise in its place. De Jure law demands it!"
 BRA_prussian_ascendance_title: "Prussian Ascendance"
 BRA_prussian_ascendance_desc: "The Duchy of Prussia, solidified de jure, shall be the core of a new grand power of Europe. Our ambitions betray our stature, but they needn't for long. We possess a spirit unbroken by law or power, impervious to external forces. We are unique in that fact: be us Brandenburg or Prussia."
 BRA_political_dynasty_title: "Political Dynasty"
 BRA_political_dynasty_desc: "The House of Hohzenzollern only recently saw elevation to the international stage of Europe. Securing holdings in Franconia and Brandenburg, we are a fledgling dynasty seeking only to grow and solidify our grip on these Imperial possessions. And so it shall be done through the power of the pen."
 BRA_magdeburg_title: "The Mighty Fortress"
 BRA_magdeburg_desc: "The unshakable Hanseatic city to our south, the Bishopric of Magdeburg, is a stronghold of both religious and mercantile values. Despite this, it sits nestled between Mittlemark and Altmark. Should they get delusions of grandeur, our western flank lays wholly undefended. That being said, perhaps they can provide the solution to that issue..."
 BRA_irontooth_title: "End the Rule of the Nobles"
 BRA_irontooth_desc: "The nobility of the Margraviate has served us rather poorly in recent years. Robber Barons run amok, threatening the foundation of the nation as a whole. They have become an issue that we need to solve, one way or another."
 BRA_burghers_in_check_title: "The Irontooth"
 BRA_burghers_in_check_desc: "The merchant class of Brandenburg openly exploits the peasantry, evades taxes, and defies the Margrave's will. For a stronger and more stable nation, we must curtail the rights of the burghers. The nickname 'The Irontooth' shan't go unheeded."
 BRA_concluding_the_transition_title: "Conclude the Transition"
 BRA_concluding_the_transition_desc: "The transition to Hohenzollern rule has been fraught with turmoil and centralization. Discontent and instability may plague Brandenburg, but it shall all end soon. The transition shall conclude."
 BRA_universita_viadrina_title: "Universita Viadrina"
 BRA_universita_viadrina_desc: "It is the Elector's duty to cultivate an environment of intelligence and culture within the nation, and there is no better method than the establishment of Brandenburg's first university. With the approval of the church, we shall erect a grand institute of learning in the town of Frankfurt an der Oder."
 BRA_kreditwerk_title: "Das Kreditwerk"
 BRA_kreditwerk_desc: "The burden of finance cannot lie solely with the monarch, nor the nobility, nor the merchants. We must create a joint organization under the control of the Elector to ensure sound management of the Margrave's fiscal policy."
 BRA_army_reform_title: "Markische Armeereform"
 BRA_army_reform_desc: "The Margraviate of Brandenburg has always relied heavily on its army. After all, we serve as the Empire's march in the east, defending him from the Polish invaders. This duty has changed over time, but our army has remained alarmingly stagnant, nearly to the point of complacency. This is a dark trend we cannot take for granted... let us call an assembly of generals to ensure modernization of tactics and technology."
 BRA_project_power_title: "Project Power"
 BRA_project_power_desc: "Brandenburg sits nestled in a virulent position between many foreign powers. We must assert ourselves so that we might not end up on the receiving end of such assertion."
 BRA_duchy_of_prussia_title: "Duchy of Prussia"
 BRA_duchy_of_prussia_desc: "" #Similar context to the Treaty of Wehlau event below.
 
 #Events:
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.t: "Albert of Brandenburg"
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.d: "Following the ascension of his brother to the Electoral seat of Brandenburg, Albert was formally a margrave of Brandenburg, but chose to follow the ecclesiastical path after his studies at the university of Frankfurt. As such when the Archbishop of Magdeburg was a clear goal where he could execute both his divine and familial duties in life. However, when the Archbishop passed away, he had not yet acquired the required age and education for the position. Furthermore, his desired position would hold great influence."
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.a: "Nothing that can't be solved with some money to grease the wheels."
 ME_Prussia_Events.1.b: "You can preach from the local chapel."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.t: "Papal Investiture"
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.d: "Due to the corrupted influence of the Brandenburgian Margrave, the Holy Father requests the bishop becomes a Hohenzollern prince, Albert"
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.a: "We will honor Pope's requests"
 ME_Prussia_Events.2.b: "The Bishopric is in our hands!"
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.t: "Hohenzollern Kin"
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.d: "Ever since the ascension of Albert, we have had a strong connection to the Hohenzollerns."
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.a: "Hohenzollern shall the bishop be!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.3.b: ""
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.t: "Prince-Archbishopric of Magdeburg"
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.d: "The reformation is in full swing, and the distinction between ecclesiastical and secular is fading in the protestant realms, and the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Archbishopric of Magdeburg have grown close over time."
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.a: "Let us ask them to unite our realms"
 ME_Prussia_Events.4.b: "Honor the separation of church and state."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.5.t: "Union with Brandenburg"

 #Above is Jay's localization
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.t: "Raubritter"
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.d: "Through unscrupulous practices do fiendish folks rise to prominence. The resurgence of Robber Barons has put a horrid streak on the Hohenzollern name, accompanied by the violence and extortionate taxation that the raubritter see fit to impose. The Margraviate's previous efforts to curtail these practices seem to be wearing off. How shall we proceed?" #The early hohenzollern efforts to get rid of robber barons, who were rampant in brandenburg
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.a: "What my Father had started, I shall finish."
 ME_Prussia_Events.6.b: "They will eventually go away."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.t: "Treaty of Prenzlau"
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.d: "The centuries of warfare with Pomerania have come to an end. With the ratification of the Treaty of Prenzlau, Emperor [Emperor.GetName] has affirmed our de jure right to the conquest of the fertile lands of Pommern. As such, the integration of Uckermark, as well as the rest of the Duchy, shall begin." #https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Prenzlau
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.a: "The duchy of Pomerania is ours!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.7.b: "Perhaps a later draft will do us better."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.t: "Supporting the Kinsmen"
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.d: "The Hohenzollern family, despite our recent rise to power, has considerable land holdings to the south, in the County of Ansbach. A poor, undeveloped land, it represents not only a familial link to Central Germany, but also an opportunity to establish our influence further into the Empire. It would be remiss of us to pass up this chance." #Supporting hohenzollerns in franconia
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.a: "United we stand!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.8.b: "Brandenburg is the future of the Hohenzollerns."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.t: "Returning the Favor"
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.d: "A ducal party has arrived professing our northward dynastic allies' belief in our success and future, not as Franconians, but as carriers of the Hohenzollern legacy. Brandenburg is surely the more powerful entity and could certainly provide ample protection to us in our time of need. They have offered to support our state for the time being; how shall we proceed?" #the event for franconians when the Prussians do the mission
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.a: "We'll closely cooperate with our family."
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.b: "We need but repay the favor."
 ME_Prussia_Events.9.c: "Indebting ourselves to them would be silly."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.t: "Berliner Religiongesprach"
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.d: "Numerous theologians and scholars have all gathered in Berlin for a once in a lifetime event. The topic is simple: reconciling the differences of Lutheran and Calvinist theology. We have long since been a bastion of religious freedom in the Empire, providing refuge to those targeted by the Inquisition. Despite this, tensions continue to rise as the people take sides in what has become a Protestant Schism, akin to the splitting of the Roman Church. Hopefully, with this conference there will be peace." #https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Religionsgespr%C3%A4ch
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.a: "A Great Development!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.10.b: "The churches can't be united. Waste of time!"
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.t: "Der Toleranzedikt"
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.d: "As religious tensions grow, it is Brandenburg's job to stifle the ever-growing flame and weather the storm ahead. The Edict of Tolerance, issued by Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I, stated that the Lutheran and Reformed Churches are to be treated as equals and the relations between them are to be regulated by law." #https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleranzedikt_(Brandenburg)
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.a: "Force the Edict!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.11.b: "This will only create more discontent."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.12.t: "Die Zwei Akademien"
 ME_Prussia_Events.12.d: "With the rise of intellectual pursuits in the Margraviate, we have seen the rise of two main universities. One is for the study and research of Arts, whilst the other focuses on the natural sciences of the world. Which shall see our patronage?" #contrast below
 ME_Prussia_Events.12.a: "Favor Akademie der Kunste."
 ME_Prussia_Events.12.b: "Favor Akademie der Naturwissenschaften."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.13.t: "Coronation of a Prussian Ruler"
 ME_Prussia_Events.13.d: ""Schlosskirche", literally Castle Church, was a church constructed in Königsberg, whose splendor was given to it by work that began in 1584. It was here, that in 1701, Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg, founded the Order of the Black Eagle. The following day he crowned himself as a King in Prussia. This began the tradition of coronating the Prussian Kings in the church, a tradition that would devour much of Prussian treasury, for those were usually lavish and full of splendour."
 ME_Prussia_Events.13.a: "Lavish Coronation in Schlosskirche."
 ME_Prussia_Events.13.b: "We shall stay humble."
 
 #Brandenburg African Company events were here but I removed them
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.17.t: "Prussian Colonization of Silesia"
 ME_Prussia_Events.17.d: "With our recent conquest of the Silesian ducal territory, we have noticed a trend of Prussian settlers choosing to establish themselves in the new conquest. The West Slavs of Silesia inherently break the homogeny of the Prussian lands. This colonization could present ample opportunity to fix this."  #The State of Prussia sent many german settlers into prussia.
 ME_Prussia_Events.17.a: "Interesting Development."
 ME_Prussia_Events.17.b: "Encourage Settlers!"
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.18.t: "Bierziese"
 ME_Prussia_Events.18.d: "With the state coffers running increasingly dry, we must find alternative sources of income. Alcohol has historically been taxed in general, but the German love for beer is something else entirely. It knows no monetary bounds, for men are willing to spend their last ducat over a simple drink. We might be able to squeeze a bit more money out of the populace through an additional excise tax." #a toll on beer
 ME_Prussia_Events.18.a: "Implement the Bierziese."
 ME_Prussia_Events.18.b: "We need not risk a conflict."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.19.t: "Bierskrieg"
 ME_Prussia_Events.19.d: "Oh dear. It appears as though the merchant class has not taken well to the recent excise tax placed on beer. Perhaps we were too hasty to tax such a vital good. Regardless, we must now deal with the consequences of our foolhardy actions." #A civil war caused by the tolls on beer

 ME_Prussia_Events.21.t: "Kammergericht"
 ME_Prussia_Events.21.d: "The Kammergericht is the highest state court of Berlin, among the centers of our administration. It deals with criminal and civil cases, superior to the local Amtsgerichte and the Landgericht Berlin. It is run directly as an Imperial court for the Hohenzollern family, unable to appeal Imperial authority but able to take on most other cases."

 ME_Prussia_Events.23.d: "In these dire times, ideals of unification are on the rise and Prussia shall lead the efforts. 'Gainst the mighty giants shall David strike out, felling oak like maple and making timber of behemoths."
 ME_Prussia_Events.23.a: "Nothing will stop us!" #It's about Prussia battling the behemoths in the hre emperorship and france to gain custody over the germans
  
 ME_Prussia_Events.24.t: "The End of the French Influence"
 ME_Prussia_Events.24.d: "In the days of old, France and Holy Roman Empire were a single state ruled by the Francian Kings. Unfortunately, all things, good or bad, come to an end. The Treaty of Verdun has seen the Frankish Empire splinter into three states, two of which would later become France and the Holy Roman Empire. It is why, France, the western neighbour of the Holy Roman Empire, has, since time immemorial, been influencing the western princes. Their influence can not only be seen in the culture, but also in their 'patronage' of enforcing the 1648's Treaty of Westphalia. This influence is, more often than not, hampering the unification of the German Peoples. Fortunately, the rising state in Prussia has decided to put an end to the French influence and has finally abased the French, preventing them from further influencing the german cities."
 ME_Prussia_Events.24.a: "Scourge of the West is defeated."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.t: "Triumph of Prussia"
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.1: "Holy Roman Empire is an entity that dates back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. The apparent state of weakness displayed by the Empire has only been reinforced by the glorious campaign lead by us against the forces of the Emperor. Having been humiliated by catastrophic losses, the imperial authority is but a shell of its former self. This proves once and for all, that the emperor is not fit for protecting the Germans. About time the german princes realized that only the Prussian crown may offer them certain independence."
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.2: "Holy Roman Empire is an entity that dates back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. Fortunately, the future of the Empire shines bright, for it is the new Emperor, [Root.Monarch.GetName] that shall decide the fate of the German People. No more shall our brethren tremble in fear of the imperial enemies!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.3: "Holy Roman Empire was an entity that dated back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. At last, the Holy Roman Empire is no more. Dismantled not just by foreign aggression, but also by internal strife, it finally met its end. As such, the German People remain splintered among many weak states that are prone to a quick  end by the hands of german enemies. It is high time Prussia took the initiative and became the defender of the German citizens."
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.a: "Let the Germans enjoy our benevolent custody"
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.b: "Wonderful."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.26.t: "A Growing City"
 ME_Prussia_Events.26.d: "The Prussian Economy, focused mostly on the growth of the military, wasn't always supportive of the cities. However, thanks to the policies of the current government, the Prussian cities are finally being filled with life and waves upon waves of immigrants are rapidly turning around the agglomerations of Prussia."
 ME_Prussia_Events.26.a: "Excellent!" #once-in-a-while event increasing dev and giving you a task to do
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.27.t: "A Holy Place Built"

 #Removed remnant of anti-german coalition
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.29.t: "Future of Prussia"
 ME_Prussia_Events.29.d: "Thousands of feet march to the beat of booming drums. A sound that usually coincides with despair bears fruit as the backbone of our great nation, spurred on by the cheers of men and women emboldened by such raw might. Never has the world bore witness to such a display, never has the world seen one such as Great Prussia. Yet, as the boots stomp on, we begin to ponder: what for? What is a rifle without a man, what is a conquest without a purpose? A nation such as ours needs not ponder such a proposal, for our justification is self-evident. We are the rulers of the Germans, through gunfire or the stroke of a pen. In the end, it is not a matter of ends, but rather means; it is a matter of Prussia's legacy. Are we to continue marching, forever into the sunrise of a new Empire? Or are we to usher in a new era of prominence and peace?" #restructure this to talk poetically on what prussia could be, a militaristic conqueror of germany, or benevolent lord of the german princes

 ME_Prussia_Events.30.t: "Fate of the Kreditwerk" #Kreditwerk institution, tag Pascal
 ME_Prussia_Events.30.d: "The debts of men and kings cannot go unfinanced. Before the time of pragmatism, simple solutions were key to the administration of nations, and the Kreditwerk is a remnant of such an era. By financing the Margraviate's debt through the estates, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could continue to spend at extorionate interest rates. Perhaps the time has come to neuter this institution once and for all."
 ME_Prussia_Events.30.a: "A gruesome institution must meet a gruesome fate"

 ME_Prussia_Events.31.t: "Treaty of Wehlau" #https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertrag_von_Wehlau 
 ME_Prussia_Events.31.d: "Long have the Prussians suffered under foreign rule, stamped down beneath a tyrant's iron fist. First the Teutons, now the Polish, but with finality we might yet proclaim them free. Free from the centuries of oppression the Prussian people have faced. Benevolence is synonymous with our governance, thus we shall take the duchy under our wing if given the opportunity. Signed in 1657 between Brandenburg and Prussia, the Treaty of Wehlau achieved just this: liberation of the Duchy of Prussia from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its firm placement under the control of Brandenburg." #Try to add some historical context, but also fit it into the eu4 perspective of a duchy of prussia subject, and trying to free it from polish influence

 ME_Prussia_Events.32.d: "The fires of the Reformation continue to burn, and our purpose has not yet ended. We continue to stand as a bastion of religious tolerance, welcoming one and all to worship God in peace and quite, away from the Romans. Yet another flock of religious minorities has arrived from abroad, seeking shelter from the constant strife and Inquisition that coincides living as heretics. They shall receive naught but open arms!" #it's about all the immigration due to the tolerance in Prussia (but not to catholics)

 ME_Prussia_Events.33.t: "Humboldt Brothers" 
 ME_Prussia_Events.33.d: "The Humboldt brothers were Prussian philosophers, linguists, government functionaries, diplomats, and the founders of the Humboldt University of Berlin. Wilhelm von Humboldt, the older brother, focused his studies on the philisophical pursuits of life, presenting himself as an intellectual through and through. Meanwhile, his younger brother Alexander von Humboldt focused his studies on incurring one revolutionary discovery after another. Launching several expeditions into Spanish America, Russia, and the United States, the Humboldt brothers were truly a pair of geniuses." #https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt
 ME_Prussia_Events.33.a: "The everlasting philosophy of Wilhelm shall guide us."
 ME_Prussia_Events.33.b: "The revolutionary discoveries of Alexander will shape the state."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.34.t: "Potsdamer Glashütte"
 ME_Prussia_Events.34.d: "Brandenburg's Elector Friedrich Wilhelm, who was crowned in the middle of the raging Thirty Years' War, took upon himself to revitalize the economy after the devastating war. Among his policies was the promotion of art within glassmaking. Under his rule, glass manufactures were constructed in Potsdam. Those would make crystal comparable to the one made in Italy and Bohemia, and one that would shine as an example of Baroque art."
 ME_Prussia_Events.34.a: "Embrace the Glass!" #apparently I did this already?
 ME_Prussia_Events.34.b: "Glass is a tad bit too sharp to embrace."
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.35.t: "Of Thaler, Groschen, and Pfennige"
 ME_Prussia_Events.35.d: "With the constant ebb and flow of the national money supply, monetary policy is typically bundled up with fiscal policy and left to the estates to manage. As such, the supply of coinage is rarely in a ruler's hands to begin with. With our recent emphasis on controlling the nation's money supply, it is time to choose the direction we intend to take this." #tag Pascal

 #Two more remnants of anti-german coaliton were here
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.43.t: "Adoption of Potato"
 ME_Prussia_Events.43.d: "The Colombian Exchange has had little effect on Great Prussia... until now. A wondrous new crop has been discovered and imported to the Old World: the potato. Originally seen as a vile root, we have learned that the starchy vegetable has an incredible amount of nutrition locked away behind its brown peel. Despite this, the peasantry have not taken a liking to the tubers. We must always encourage innovation, and as such, this shan't do!" #Yeah, talk about how the nation is making strives to make peasants adopt potato, for even more context, tag Pascal
 ME_Prussia_Events.43.a: "Embrace the Tater."
 ME_Prussia_Events.43.b: "We need not Potatoes!"
 
 ME_Prussia_Events.44.t: "Growth of Trade"
 ME_Prussia_Events.44.d: "Our nation's income has historically been dominated from taxes levied from the nobles, either in the form of grain or men. We lack any grand trade cities to facilitate the purchase and sale of goods on any large scale, thus we have sidelined such concepts. Despite this, Prussian trade expansion has seen recent upticks. We would do well to continue this trend."

 PRU_prussian_union_desc: "The many Christian denominations within our borders need not fear our rule, yet they sequester themselves away in groups of their own. This is most unchristian.

 PRU_kickstart_the_industry_desc: "Industrial expansion in Prussia has been a slot process thusfar.

 PRU_the_amber_coast_title: "The Amber Coast"
