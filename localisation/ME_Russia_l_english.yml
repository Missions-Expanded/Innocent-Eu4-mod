 ### MISSIONS ###
 rus_unite_russia_title: "Sobiranye Russkih Zemel"
 rus_unite_russia_desc: "Moscow's drive to unite all east-slavic peoples under the Tsardom began under Ivan III, but picked up speed following a string of successes against both Horde and Poland alike. Ivan the Terrible, controversial as he may be, expanded the Russian state to an extent that it reached the Urals and beyond. His diplomatic prowess allowed Russia to navigate the stiff situation between the powerful Commonwealth, with initial ties being cemented with Vienna as a possible flank against the growing Ottomans. One thing is for sure, Mother Russia must gather her children."   
 rus_russian_patriarchate_title: "Russian Patriarch"
 rus_russian_patriarchate_desc: "Moscow and Constantinople haven't had the best relations, starting in 1448 with the ascension of Jonah, who became Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus' without the agreement of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Eastern Orthodoxy has always been autocephalous and many churches have a degree of autonomy, but this made Moscow de facto independent. None of this was made easier by the recent falling out at Florence and the chaos during the Muscovite civil war. The fall of the 2nd Rome made Muscovy hungry for power and prestige, and Moscow became the 3rd Rome, worsening relations. It was only a matter of time before Moscow split from Constantinople, being the only Orthodox power left anyway."
 rus_ecclesiastical_reservation_title: "Ecclesiastical Reservation"
 rus_ecclesiastical_reservation_desc: "One of the many reforms of Peter the great saw Caeseropapism, or land reductions, of church property. The church apparatus effectively became a department of state, as many traditional church leaders were replaced by young-able bodied (and influenced) men, loyal to the Tsar."
 rus_moscow_third_rome_title: "The Third Rome"
 rus_moscow_third_rome_desc: "'So know, pious king, that all the Christian kingdoms came to an end and came together in a single kingdom of yours, two Romes have fallen, the third stands, and there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Tsardom' - Philotheus"
 rus_syvateishiy_synod_title: "Syvateishiy Synod"
 rus_syvateishiy_synod_desc: "The Russian church is too archaic in its practices and, most importantly, its devotion. Russians look to the Patriarch more than they look to the Tsar and nobles are far more interested in praying than serving the government. Not only does the church need reforming, so does Russia, and by shaking the very foundation of the average Rus, we can more easily break their traditions. The Holy Synod will replace the job of the Patriarch with ten clerics, whom we could 'guide' into doing what the state wants"
 rus_velikaya_rus_title: "Velikaya Rus"
 rus_velikaya_rus_desc: "All lands of the Great Rus must fall under the grace of Russia. Never before has a centralised Slavic power ruled over such vast territories. But time have changed. No longer is Russia bogged down by ambitious Boyars or bickering principalities. No horde can slow down the relentless push east, unlike the times of Kyiv. Our threat lies to the west, and Great Rus must be strong for the future.

 ### EVENTS ###
 ME_Russia_Events.1.t: "Synodalnyi Period"
 ME_Russia_Events.1.d: "The Synodal Period came about as a consequence of Peter and Catherine's reforms. The name comes from the governance of the Most Holy Governing Synod which was subservient to the crown. The number of priests was downsized, and some of them downgraded to serfs, strict legislation prevented the monastics from leaving their monasteries. On the one side, the Empire protected the church. For example, it was forbidden to change from Orthodoxy to other faiths. On the other side, the church paid its dues by losing independence. Priests were obliged to break the secret of confession in case someone plotted against the state and the Emperor. From these developments, the independence of the Russian Synods had been eroded, subservient to the Tsar; The Russian Orthodox Church is truly Russian again."
