 authority_from_and_under_ottomans_desc: "Though some may see them as far off intruders into the sacred lands of Arabia, the Ottomans have been a rather stabilizing force in many regards. The administrative sector of Mecca and Medina in particular have been flourishing underneath the watchful eyes and helpful hands of the Ottomans, and it is something we should be thankful for rather than outright opposed to."

 qaramita_sect_of_mecca_desc: "Though they date back to the time of the end of the Sassanid Empire, the Qaramita sect raised alarms all over Arabia and the Abbasid Caliphate when they raided and attacked Mecca, more specifically the Black Stone of the Kaaba. Though this situation was eventually rectified, the lessons taught by the Qaramita sect showed that we must not be isolationist just as we once had been, nor should be opposed to military engagements even if we see a prime opportunity for ourselves."

In the past, the journey into Arabia has often been Treacherous and raiders and bandits would attack unsuspecting caravans of people on Hajj, leading to faithful Muslims being punished for follow their faith.

 history_with_the_mamluks_desc: "The time we had under the Mamluks was more or less stable and our leaders were appointed by them, but their influence was never absolute or concrete. One thing we did retain from them, however, was the system of recruitment the instilled in their own land. Though we may change around certain parts of it, the essence of it remains the same and serves us well in building up and maintaining a suitable military."

 defenders_of_the_faithful: "Defenders of the Faithful"
 defenders_of_the_faithful_desc: "There are many who would see Mecca and Medina under their own control, wanting to make the Hajj profitable for themselves and not the true holders and protectors of the holy sites. We will hold these nefarious people off and defend those who are truly faithful to Islam and Allah and resist invasion after invasion they throw at us, for the ones of the true faith will always win out in the end."
 
 ottoman_advisors_and_courtiers: "Ottoman Advisors and Courtiers"
 ottoman_advisors_and_courtiers_desc: "As the palaces and courts within our land continue to progress in size and luxury, there is a need for smarter and greater minds serving in them. Thankfully, our connections to the Ottomans give us just what we need in terms of this: grand advisors who are willing to serve the true sharifs of Mecca and Medina."
