 ### MISSIONS ###
 
 dlh_promote_mil_advisor_title: "Promote a Diwan-i-Ariz"
 dlh_promote_mil_advisor_desc: "[Root.GetName]'s collapse has caused a great deal of chaos in our administration, with both our army and government left vacant and unorganised. Balban may have strengthened the central core of the military, but this is nothing without someone to fill the position."
 dlh_disenfranchise_slaves_title: "Disenfranchise the Slaves"
 dlh_disenfranchise_slaves_desc: "Balban began a tradition of favouring nobles and Indians over the influential Turkic slave soldiers, as their power threatened the Sultans tenable position. It is important that the power of these slaves are limited, to prevent any threat of coup, like in Bengal, or a return to the previous Mamluk Sultanate."
 dlh_balban_reforms_title: "Continuing the Reforms"
 dlh_balban_reforms_desc: "The beginning of the Alai era, after the collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate, saw [Root.GetName]'s army move away from traditional slave soldiery and Turkic warriors, to Khasah-khail, or Special Infantry. Balban also ordered the separation of the military department from the Diwan-i–Wizarai, and placed the military department under a the Diwan-i-Ariz. These reforms helped strengthen [Root.GetName]'s military, promoting individual excellence rather than standardised training, ensuring that each soldier trained competitively and to their limit."
 dlh_issue_land_title: "Issuing Land Grants"
 dlh_issue_land_desc: "Land is distributed through 3 methods. Iqta land is given as a subsidiary instead of outright payment for officials, as thanks for their services. Khalisa land is the Sultan's own, and the revenue generated is used to fund the royal household. Finally, Inam land is for religious officials to appease the clergy. In order to prevent disaster once again, we must find a balance between patronage and preventing puppet status."
 dlh_textile_innovations_title: "Textile Innovations"
 dlh_textile_innovations_desc: "Thousands of weavers are employed in Kharkanas, where yards upon yards of robes, silks and cottons would be weaved and produced. In order to prevent any shortages in the future, we must ensure, as early adopters of the water wheel and the worm gear roller, that our monopoly on textiles does not falter"
 dlh_heavy_regulations_title: "Regulating Trade"
 dlh_heavy_regulations_desc: "While the reforms of Alauddin Khalji have been heavily criticised, being seen as burdensome and controlling, they have prevented price fluctuations and severe grain shortages in times of turmoil and disaster. However, it wouldn't hurt to open up some of these restrictions, as it has become clear that trade is becoming the dominant source of income. We must still keep a close eye, before our riches spiral into the hands of others."
 dlh_artillery_title: "Proliferating Falconets"
 dlh_artillery_desc: "The change in modern warfare has placed focus on Gunpowder and guns. We must acquire these weapons if we are to stand the test of time, and to further our conquests. While our military will never truly embrace these new weapons, we can ornament our military with small siege weapons to enhance our siege potential."
 dlh_tamil_spices_title: "Tamil Trade Guilds"
 dlh_tamil_spices_desc: "The newly acquired territories along the Coromandel Coast is home to an autonomous community of traders, the Tamil Kings. These merchants hold great control over the spice trade, with exports from Malaya and Southern India into Arabia and beyond. Their autonomy is annoying, yet any collapse of the network they have established could potentially cause chaos in the trading world. It is important that their independence is mildly recognised, provided that they pledge allegiance to the Sultan, and adhere to some social policies."
 dlh_elephant_warfare_title: "Elephant Warfare"
 dlh_elephant_warfare_desc: "The forces were commanded by the Sultans as they were the chief lawgiver and the final of the court of appeal. Amirs, Khans, and Maliks were the titles of the military gradation. Men from different nations were enlisted in the army. The army was divided into infantry, cavalry, and elephant corps, with elephants being seen as worth 500 horsemen. They are large and hardy, and have helped us conquer swaths of India. We must continue the long-standing tradition of Elephant warfare."
 dlh_qazis_title: "A New Qazi-ul-Qazat"
 dlh_qazis_desc: "The Qazi-ul-Qazat was the chief of the Justice Department. He was assisted in this task by several Qazis and Kotwals who helped him in keeping law and order in the country and in the administration of justice. There is an issue with this, as several Ulema happen to also be Qazis, in which they have shown disdain for our Hindu subjects, and often misinterpret Quranic law to further their own needs. The only power is the sultan, so it would be wise to appoint someone who works for the state, not the church."
 dlh_city_of_taj_title: "The City of the Taj"
 dlh_city_of_taj_desc: "A city lies on the banks of the Yamuna, dating back to the legends of Krishna and Mahabharata. While not nearly as grand as [Root.GetName] once was, it is in a prime position in the centre of the Doab to grow, with local bazars and entrepots already established. With some effort, the city could become a principle administrative centre, and the heart of [Root.GetName]'s resurgence"
 dlh_claiming_india_title: "Lay Claim on India"
 dlh_claiming_india_desc: "Much of Northern India is still in tumultuous ruin, with various states destroying each other over and over again. In order to achieve our dreams of a unified India, we must have the army for it. We once fielded an army three Lakh big, waged wars with the Mongols, defied any Chinese attempts to breach the Himalayas. Nothing should stop us."
 dlh_diamond_delhi_title: "A Diamond in the Rough"
 dlh_diamond_delhi_desc: "[Root.GetName]'s history has been tumultuous and destructive. Massive population loss and general ruin has brought the city to the brink of death numerous times. However, the oldest city in India has stayed strong, and the city is once again flourishing under renewed leadership. Surrounded by warfare, It has remained bejewelled and dazzling; a diamond in the rough"
 dlh_bengali_jamdani_title: "Bengali Jamdani"
 dlh_bengali_jamdani_desc: "While it is upsetting that Bengal has flourished without our administration, The previous Sultans have indeed left us a territory with great potential. The city of Dhaka is one example, with thousands of weavers producing the most beautiful works of fabric ever seen by the Sultan."
 dlh_utilise_shipbuilding_title: "Utilise Local Shipbuilding"
 dlh_utilise_shipbuilding_desc: "Unlike many Indian Sultanates, [Root.GetName] never had a seafaring tradition. This is why it is important to utilise what our fragments have created. Bengal will be the centre of shipbuilding, having a strong riverine tradition, and merchant links with much of south Asia. We can appoint the old Chief of admiralty to help speed up production"
 dlh_malabar_coast_title: "The Konkan Coast"
 dlh_malabar_coast_desc: "The Konkan coast is home to the Konkan ports, and have ties to Arabia, where steeds and cavalry are imported. The ports here are of vital importance for any aspiring Indian Ocean Empire, and thus we must sieze it for ourselves."
 dlh_furthest_reach_title: "Our Furthest Reach"
 dlh_furthest_reach_desc: "The 14th century saw us lose many of our southern posessions. We bordered the tip of the Indian-Subcontinent, traded with the Arabs and Chinese, and our influence extended beyond the oceans. With our massive army marching into the old Hindu lands of Vijayanagara, we can finally reclaim the provinces that were so ruthlessly stolen from us."
 dlh_tamil_rule_title: "The Tamils Cannot Run"
 dlh_tamil_rule_desc: "The Tamil Kings generally enjoyed autonomy, no matter who ruled them. Even in the days of Chandragupta or Rajendra, no-one could upend them. After our rapid conquests, they were quick to rally to any leader who was not a Muslim, placing Bukka and Harijara as their leaders. Yet they were even quicker to elicit major autonomy from royal affairs. No more! Their entitlement has run out of steam."
 dlh_dominate_gulf_title: "Dominating the Gulf"
 dlh_dominate_gulf_desc: "The West Coast of India bustles with arabian trade. Horses, Spices and Rice flow multidirectionally across the ocean. Our control over the west face of India has preseneted us with an oppurtunity to utilise our position. That being said, we might need a few more ships."
 dlh_let_fires_burn_title: "Let the Fires Burn!"
 dlh_let_fires_burn_desc: "[Root.GetName] is no stranger to destruction, and it seems that fate has a way with irony. Our past is filled with plunder, mutual destruction and terror. It just doesn't help that the riches brought home enrich our nation in such a way that we cannot resist it. "
 dlh_seize_doab_title: "Seizing the Doab"
 dlh_seize_doab_desc: "The Doab runs parallel to the Ganges, the heart of northern India, and thus holds great strategic potential. Once beholden to us, the Sharqi governors betrayed the old Tughluq dynasty and the current Sayyid dynasty, siezing the area as part of the Jaunpuri sultanate. This abomination must end if we are to continue our survival."
 dlh_traitors_no_more_title: "Traitors No More"
 dlh_traitors_no_more_desc: "Establishing themselves in 1394, controlling Jaunpur, the Sharqis have long coveted our throne, but with our strength renewed, we finally can reclaim the behemoth that lies across the Ganges. They are still adept governors however, meaning that it would be useful to employ them as part of our local administration, easing the transition. We could employ them as Subadars, provincial administrators responsible for suppressing internal revolts, maintaining order and collecting revenue. They would also have full control over the provincial army, ensuring that our army is well garrisoned and managed."
 dlh_reintegrate_empire_title: "Re-Integrating the Empire"
 dlh_reintegrate_empire_desc: "Tamerlane must've been chuffed to hear that [Root.GetName] began collapsing after his invasion. Well he must be rolling in his grave right now. With the capture of Jaunpur, and the collapse of the Rajputs, we can finally quell our collapse and reclaim all of Hindustan!"
 dlh_quell_tiger_title: "Quell the Tiger's Roars"
 dlh_quell_tiger_desc: "In a disastrous defeat, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shahi declared Bengali independence, a state that has been nothing but trouble ever since. While much of their conquests were quickly returned to us, it is still worrying that their influence may dominate us both economically and militarily. Bengal is too important to be ignored; we must take it back!"
 dlh_subjugate_gajapats_title: "Subjugating the Gajapatis"
 dlh_subjugate_gajapats_desc: "The Kingdom of Orissa and its inland subjects act as nothing but a fuel for a growing flame. Their intellectual prowess gives them the ability to stir conflict by supporting any aspiring Raja or Noble. Once we have taken the area, however, their Vedic literature may come useful, as understanding our Brahmin Subjects mya help us ease tensions."
 dlh_conquer_malwa_title: "Restoring Malvi Order"
 dlh_conquer_malwa_desc: "We may have had better than average relations with the Malwa Sultanate, but their betrayal stills leaves a sore spot. After we have consolidated the Garjats and Rajputana, they are unfortunately in our way towards the deccan."
 dlh_revenge_bahmanis_title: "Bahmanid Revenge"
 dlh_revenge_bahmanis_desc: "The root of all our problems. It was unbeknownst to the founders of [Root.GetName] that a Chisti Muslim of all people would trigger the downfall of [Root.GetName]. The loss of the Bahmanis triggered a downfall that we have only recently reversed. The traitorous Bahmanids stand as a testament of heresy and treason, something that can be mediated violently "
 dlh_daulatabad_title: "Returning to Daulatabad"
 dlh_daulatabad_desc: "In 1328, Muhammed bin Tughluq transferred the capital of his kingdom to Devagiri, and renamed it Daulatabad. The sultan made Daulatabad his second capital in 1327. The idea behind transferring the capital was rational, because it lay more or less in the centre of the kingdom, and geographically secured the capital from the north-west frontier attacks. In the Daulatabad fort, he found the area arid & dry. Hence he built a huge reservoir for water storage & connected it with a far-away river. He used siphon system to fill up the reservoir. However, his capital-shift strategy failed miserably. With our renewed control, we can once again attempt to create a new capital in the area."
 dlh_wootz_steel_title: "Wootz Steel"
 dlh_wootz_steel_desc: "Uchu Kabbina, or commonly mistranslated as Wootz Steel, is one of the most durable metals in Southern India. It is often traded as goods, gifts and weapons. This "Superior Steel" has had stifled production due to our rapid and disorganising conquests. it would be wise to stimulate local foundries, in order to show the world our prestige."
 dlh_hindustan_title: "Uniting Hindustan"
 dlh_hindustan_desc: "We were once the largest empire the world had ever seen. We braved the Mongols and the Timurids, and ourselves. Now it is time to unite Hindustan once and for all, A home of riches, diversity and strength; in adversity."
 dlh_weather_future_title: "Weathering the Future"
 dlh_weather_future_desc: "Tamerlane's sack left us in despair. Our empire has crumbled, thousands lay dead in the aftermath. [Root.GetName], the once glorious city is left as but a shadow of its prosperity, and our many breakaway states eye the throne hungrily, eager to reclaim what we have lost. But no more, for [Root.GetName] shall rise again, even if it will be gruelling and destructive."
 dlh_deal_with_splinters_title: "Dealing With the Splinters"
 dlh_deal_with_splinters_desc: "Our rapid collapse allowed many warlords and governors to scatter into splinter states, that lie where we once conquered. Jaunpur, Bengal and Sirhind - the latter of which we retain nominal control - are eyeing up the fractured territories, causing chaos in the region. Chaos, that can be exploited"
 dlh_weather_future_desc: "Tamerlane's sack left us in despair. Our empire has crumbled, thousands lay dead in the aftermath. [Root.GetName], the once glorious city is left as but a shadow of its prosperity, and our many breakaway states eye the throne hungrily, eager to reclaim what we have lost. But no more, for [Root.GetName] shall rise again, even if it will be gruelling and destructive."
 dlh_deal_with_splinters_title: "Dealing With the Splinters"
 dlh_deal_with_splinters_desc: "Our rapid collapse allowed many warlords and governors to scatter into splinter states, that lie where we once conquered. Jaunpur, Bengal and Sirhind - the latter of which we retain nominal control - are eyeing up the fractured territories, causing chaos in the region. Chaos, that can be exploited"
 dlh_loyal_rajputs_title: "The Loyal Rajputs"
 dlh_loyal_rajputs_desc: "Jangladesh and the local Rajput clans have remained loyal towards [Root.GetName] since Timurs plunder. They appear to be the most willing of our vassals to rejoin the empire, something that can be hastened, if we "patronise" their loyalty further."
 dlh_descend_into_rajputana_title: "Descending into Rajputana"
 dlh_descend_into_rajputana_desc: "Many Rajput clans appear to be distasteful towards our renewed leadership. They consistently deny our leadership, and talks of unification can potentially rid any chance sultanate rule in Rajputana. This cannot be allowed, as Rajputana holds lands that may be vital for us, especially when reaching for the traitorous Bahaminis."
 dlh_follow_indus_title: "Following the Indus"
 dlh_follow_indus_desc: "The Sind Sultanate continues to reject our subjugation. This wouldn't be too much of an issue, but the Sultanates control over the Indus river has the potential to strangle the city of Multan. Since we now have a launch pad down the river, it would be wise to secure our economic hegemony."
 dlh_returning_gujarat_title: "Returning to Gujarat"
 dlh_returning_gujarat_desc: "The Gujarati Sultans hold immense riches and power over the Arabian gulf, with links to both the Horse and Cloth trade. It's no wonder that the Europeans sailed around a continent just to retain access to these markets. In the past, their independence was met with plunder, yet we could never retain control for the populace did not want it. With promises of greater mercantile freedom, we may be met with slightly less resistance"
 dlh_reinvigorate_ties_title: "Reinvigorating Arabian Ties"
 dlh_reinvigorate_ties_desc: "Arabia is home to many horses that have been used in conquests for centuries. [Root.GetName] utilised them in our rapid conquests of India, and innovated in the art of cavalry warfare. However, the encroaching Europeans and Ottomans seek to control the Indian Ocean for themselves, causing the already fragile maritime silk road to become even more spontaneously chaotic. In order to continue this supply of horses, we can descend onto Africa, under the guise of protecting our merchants, and land a foothold on the horn."
 dlh_balance_of_trade_title: "Favourable Trade Balance"
 dlh_balance_of_trade_desc: "[Root.GetName] has always had greater exports than imports, resulting in a favourable balance of trade. This is changing, however, due to the growth of manufacturing outside of India. As a result, we must ensure that our monopolistic attitude remains firm, and in reality."
 dlh_malvi_architecture_title: "Malvi Architecture"
 dlh_malvi_architecture_desc: "Malwa, while unruly, appeared to have used their time effectively, resulting in many great works of art and architecture. While it is custom to destroy and pillage, there is something about the place that stifles the Sultan, for he has become infatuated with Mandu, the Capital. The Jahaz Mahal, Rani Ruptami Pavilion and the Delhi Darwaza still stand after the conquest, and it is imperative to preserver these monuments."
 dlh_suzerain_deccan_title: "Suzerain of the Deccan"
 dlh_suzerain_deccan_desc: "It is time to finally rid ourselves of the traitouris Bahmanids. Their fertile plateaus and doabs are prime locations for expansion. It is here where we can expand the influence of the crown, by enacting new land decrees for revenue and construction. We do not want another noble seizing power for themselves"
 dlh_diamond_city_title: "A City of Diamonds"
 dlh_diamond_city_desc: "Golconda produces much of the worlds diamonds, but has another purpose too. Not only are gems mined, but also pearls and an influx of many precious metals flow through the Raichur Doab from the Arabian and Indian Oceans. It was here when Alauddin Khalji crowned himself with the Koh-i-Noor diamond, a symbol of power and absolutism. It is here where the minting of coins can flourish. A nearby town by the name of Hyderabad has been growing, due to the importance of a standardised place for exchange. Bazzars and Kharkhanas can be built here to enhance the growing needs of the Populace."
 dlh_prevent_collapse_title: "Preventing Collapse"
 dlh_prevent_collapse_desc: "The 14th century saw territory after territory lost, sack after sack of Delhi, and in the face of imminent destruction, we persevered. The last step in securing our position in the world is to ensure that no power-hungry noble coerces any region te rebel. Subadars must me loyal and capable, subservient to the Sultan and the people. All we need is the aparatus to do so."
 dlh_repell_lodis_title: "Repelling the Lodis"
 dlh_repell_lodis_desc: "Across the Indus lies Bahlul Lodi, an Afghan warlord who has declared nominal fealty towards us, and yet acts on his own accordance and threatens the Sultan's position. The rebellious state of Sirhind appears to be making plans to seize the Sayyid throne, and Bahlul may only ignite an exposed gunpowder barrel. It would be wise to prevent this"
 dlh_assert_control_title: "Asserting Control Again"
 dlh_assert_control_desc: "The time has come to end our fractured domain, and assert full crown control over our vassals. Our strength has grown, and it is time to reclaim all of our lands. It will be tough, so we must tread carefully, but in time, we will be victorious"
 dlh_encroach_kabul_title: "Encroaching on Kabul"
 dlh_encroach_kabul_desc: "Kabul and the Timurid princes that lie beyond the Indus lie safe and sound, knowing that an Indian Sultanate has yet to breach the mountains surrounding the Khyber Pass. It is important that we seize the defensive Hindu Kush mountains while the Timurid princes continue to squabble, lest a new Mongol power arises and threatens all of India "
 dlh_afghan_buffer_title: "An Afghan Buffer"
 dlh_afghan_buffer_desc: "Now we have reached the Hindu Kush, we can finally begin enacting revenge on the dastardly Timurids. First, the afghans lie in our way. While they have been a source of suffering for centuries, many of our nobility have Afghan heritage, including some of our previous sultans. It would be wise to seek out their expertise before striking the heartlands of the Timurids"
 dlh_tamerlane_commeupance_title: "Tamerlane's Comeuppance"
 dlh_tamerlane_commeupance_desc: "Much of Samarkand's glory comes from the plunder of Delhi, the looting of many, and the slaughter of thousands. Now the Tiger is dead, and the squabbling Timurids can no longer project power like they used to. With our army on the gates of Samarkand, we shall plunder and destroy, let them know our wrath. Hell hath no fury like a Sultan scorned"
 dlh_secure_cavalry_title: "Securing Cavalry"
 dlh_secure_cavalry_desc: "While it is useful to have strong trade links, trade is still expensive and waterways are fragile. The Arabian penisula, while rife with horses, is too competitive for the Sultan. Instead, he looks towards East Africa. With and already established merchant community and stables, it appears as if our military is invited in"
 dlh_grow_diaspora_title: "Growing the Diaspora"
 dlh_grow_diaspora_desc: "The Merchants of Gujarat saw no trouble in our conquests, and it is still a common sight to see indian traders of the Swahili Coast. The trade there is fertile, and we have the oppuritunity to invite some of our people to settle in the areas."
 dlh_cannon_foundries_title: "Berari Artillery"
 dlh_cannon_foundries_desc: "Warfare has evolved from typical line charges and sword battles, to long and drawn out gunpowder battles. We require a place where our cannons can be manufactured. The Bright minds of the Deccan have already constructed a place in Illchipur, and it would be wise to seize production for ourselves"
 dlh_sarf_e_khars_title: "Integrating the Sarf-e-Khas"
 dlh_sarf_e_khars_desc: "The Bahmanis, traitorous as they may be, did instate a large and complex form of administration, allowing for cheap and grand recruitment. With a little shuffling around, we too can benefit from the system of Sarf-e-Khas"

 ### EVENTS ###

 ME_Delhi_Events.1.t: "Monumental Gardens"
 ME_Delhi_Events.1.d: "Believed to be one of the oldest full dome building in Delhi, the Bada Gumbad is one of 4 monuments that are in the Lodi gardens. The Bada Gumbad was constructed to provide a gateway to the nearby mosque or a large walled enclosure. Although the structure does not house any tomb, there is a platform in the central courtyard that suggests the structure to be a burial place. Three out of five bays in the mosque have domes whereas the remaining two have vaulted roofs\n\nThe dome, the mosque and the mehman khana are constructed of red, grey and black stone, including grey quartzite and red sandstone. The interior is elaborately ornamented with painted stucco. Coloured tiles, incised carvings, and painted plaster on the mosque are decorated with foliage, flowers, geometric patterns, and Quranic inscriptions."
 ME_Delhi_Events.1.opt1: "These gardens will be immortalised"

 ME_Delhi_Events.2.t: "Aram Bagh"
 ME_Delhi_Events.2.d: "'It always appears to me, that one of the chief defects of Hindustan is the want of artificial watercourses. I had intended, wherever I might fix my residence, to construct water-wheels, to produce an artificial stream, and to lay out an elegant and regularly planned pleasure ground. Shortly after coming to Agra I passed the Jumna with this object in view, and examined the country to pitch upon a fit spot for a garden. The whole was so ugly and detestable that I repassed the river quite repulsed and disgusted. In consequence of the want of beauty and of the disagreeable aspect of the country, I gave up my intention of making a charbagh; but as no better situation presented itself near Agra, I was finally compelled to make the best of this same spot.... In every corner I planted suitable gardens, in every garden I sowed roses and narcissus regularly, and in beds corresponding to each other. We were annoyed by three things in Hindustan; one was its heat, another the strong winds, and the third its dust. Baths were the means of removing all three inconveniences.'"
 ME_Delhi_Events.2.opt1: "Gardens are a beautiful way of memorialising the past"

 ME_Delhi_Events.3.t: "Renovating the Qutb Minar Complex"
 ME_Delhi_Events.3.d: "The Qutb Complex are a group of monuments and buildings built during the 13th and 14th century in Delhi. Construction of the Qutb Minar in the complex, named after the religious figure Sufi Saint Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, was begun by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who later became the first Sultan of [Root.GetName] of the Mamluk dynasty. It was continued by his successor Iltumish, and finally completed much later by Firoz Shah Tughlaq in 1368. The Qubbat-ul-Islam Mosque, stands next to the Qutb Minar. This Mosque is preceded by the Alai-Darwaza-i,A domed gateway decorated with red sandstone and inlaid white marble decorations, inscriptions in Naskh Script and latticed stone screens. This is the first building in India to employ Islamic Architectural principles in its construction and ornamentation. With its pointed arches and spearhead of fringes, identified as lotus buds, it adds grace to the Qubbat-ul-Islam mosque to which it served as an entrance.\n\nThe recent clashes and conflict has seen the site fall into disrepair. Many are calling for it to be a monument to peace and honouring the fallen. This gives us the excuse to rebuild the site to our fitting, no matter what is wanted by the populace"
 ME_Delhi_Events.3.opt1: "Our victories must honour our fallen"
 ME_Delhi_Events.3.opt2: "These monuments are but a testament to Allah"

 ME_Delhi_Events.4.t: "Approaching Multan"
 ME_Delhi_Events.4.d: "Sitting at the crossroads of two tributaries, Multan is fertile, strategic and rich. Rich enough to have its own minting system and Cotton plantations. as we now have it our hands, we must invest in this city, enriching both us and the surrounding area."
 ME_Delhi_Events.4.opt1: "Invest in minting"
 ME_Delhi_Events.4.opt2: "Stimulate cotton plantations"
 ME_Delhi_Events.4.opt3: "Patronise local merchants"

 ME_Delhi_Events.5.t: "Cambay Cloth"
 ME_Delhi_Events.5.d: "Cambay is one of the most beautiful cities as regards the artistic architecture of its houses and the construction of its mosques. The reason is that the majority of its inhabitants are foreign merchants, who continually build there beautiful houses and wonderful mosques -- an achievement in which they endeavour to surpass each other." - Ibn Batutta\n\nCambay Is the largest entrepot in western India, linked to the Arabian world. It also contains a large community of cloth weavers, where local cloth is known as 'Cambay Cloth'. Similar to Jamdani Dhakai, the cloth holds a special status among rulers, who see it as an immense source of wealth. It would be wise to stimulate local production"
 ME_Delhi_Events.5.opt1: "Surely this cannot end?"

 ME_Delhi_Events.6.t: "The Decline of Cambay"
 ME_Delhi_Events.6.d: "Owing principally to the gradually increasing difficulty of access by water by the silting up of the gulf, Cambay's commerce has long since fallen away, and the City is becoming poorer and dilapidated. The spring tides rise upwards of 30 ft and in a channel usually so shallow that it is a serious danger to shipping. This presents a new opportunity, as the many artisans have shifted towards agate production, widely renowned in china. What should we do?"
 ME_Delhi_Events.6.opt1: "Like some rocks could perform better than handcrafted cloth"
 ME_Delhi_Events.6.opt2: "We must save the city from economic doom!"

 ME_Delhi_Events.7.t: "A City of Monuments"
 ME_Delhi_Events.7.d: "Our army enters Mandu in the still of day, the Bazars are empty and the shops are closed. Malwa's Sultan is long gone, and the territory has surrendered. Typically, splinter states like these would have been ravaged long ago, but our Sultan has spared Mandu for its beauty.\n\nThe early monuments appear to be assembled out of the materials of earlier Hindu temples, according to the Islamic plan and convention. But nothing seems to have been done to conceal or alter their essential Hindu appearance. Among them are the Kamal Maula Masjid, the Lal Masjid, Dilawar Khan's Masjid and the Masjid of Malik Mughis in Mandu."
 ME_Delhi_Events.7.opt1: "The people should be grateful for our mercy"

 ME_Delhi_Events.8.t: "Brahmins and the Jizya Tax"
 ME_Delhi_Events.8.d: "In the 13th century, The Brahmins were refused exemption from the Jizya tax by the sultan Alauddin Khalji, in order to "coerce" them into conversion. Times have changed, and it appears that this policy is doing nothing but harm our relations with the Hindus. Should we reverse this?"
 ME_Delhi_Events.8.opt1: "Let us appease the Upper Castes"
 ME_Delhi_Events.8.opt2: "They will fall to Allah eventually"

 ME_Delhi_Events.9.t: "Circulation of the Hammira Mahakavya"
 ME_Delhi_Events.9.d: "The Hammira-Mahakavya is a Indian Sanskrit epic poem written by the Jain scholar Nayachandra Suri. It is a legendary biography of the 13th century  Chahamana king Hammira. The epic, while composed in the early 1400's, has seen renewal partly due to our conquest of heavily Jain-populated areas, but also due to a redistribution by Nayachandra's disciple; Nayahamsa. The epic has become an issue for the Sultan, as the end of the story contains a section about the Old Sultan Alauddin Khalji, and the protagonists defeat at the hands of him. Hammira was a Ranastambhapura Rajput, and the area holds vital significance to the Rajputs, so the book may enhance old grudges.\n\nNow, we could censor the book, but that may appear tyrannical and unjust. Allowing the circulation may appease the populace, but weakens the power of the Sultan. What should we do?"
 ME_Delhi_Events.9.opt1: "Banning books is not the way to please anyone"
 ME_Delhi_Events.9.opt2: "Authority lies in the Sultan, and will not be challenged"

 ME_Delhi_Events.10.t: "Growth of Interreligious Debates"
 ME_Delhi_Events.10.d: "Our Relationship with the Jains of Gujarat has been tenuous at best, but the relative peace and prosperity has allowed for the rise of mutual religious assimilation. Already, the growth of Sikhism has sparked debates about the worship of idols and Deities, as well as the study of Monotheism and Polytheism, and how the sects of Hinduism and Islam intertwine. This is seen as utterly blasphemous to many in the clergy, who have ordered a clamp down on this haram, but promoting separatism may cause issues later down the line."
 ME_Delhi_Events.10.opt1: "The Study of faith is fascinating"
 ME_Delhi_Events.10.opt2: "Muslims do not belong with Hindus"

 ME_Delhi_Events.11.t: "Mian Bhuwa"
 ME_Delhi_Events.11.d: "Mian Bhuwa was a wazir of Sultan Sikandar Lodi for many years. Mian Bhuwa prepared a treatise in Persian on medicines in which the prescriptions of ancient Indian medicinal texts as well as those of Khurasan and Iran were incorporated. It is popularly known as Tib-i Sikandari.\n\nAs the court physician, he was well educated, and drew on Sankscrit Classical writers, with his treatise being a standard for followers of indigenous medicine."
 ME_Delhi_Events.11.opt1: "Grant him a place in court"
 ME_Delhi_Events.11.opt2: "His works will teach the future"

 ME_Delhi_Events.12.t: "Detaining Bahlul"
 ME_Delhi_Events.12.d: "Bahlul is one of the most influential Landowners in northern India, controlling incredibly fertile lands and the rich city of Lahore, while also watching the decline of our nation with disgust. His presence threatens the Sayyid position, and thus our spymaster has conjured a plan to capture and defeat Bahlul once and for all"
 ME_Delhi_Events.12.opt1: "The Sayyids reign supreme"

 ME_Delhi_Events.13.t: "The Rajput Coalition"
 ME_Delhi_Events.13.d: "Our encroachment into Rajputana has caused a stir in the local Rajput clans, who believe that our ascension threatens their way of life. An ambitious Mewari leader named Rana Sanga has taken the Mewari Kingdom and is discussing how to deal with us. We must prepare for this"
 ME_Delhi_Events.13.opt1: "Preposterous!, rally the troops"

 ME_Delhi_Events.14.t: "The Rajput Coalition"
 ME_Delhi_Events.14.d: "The Delhi Sultanate has been making entry Rajput lands and appears to be closing in on our nation, causing a stir in the local Rajputs. As one of the last Hindu kingdoms remaining, this cannot stand. We must form a coalition against the Muslim invaders, ensuring Hindu independence"
 ME_Delhi_Events.14.opt1: "We must prepare against the Muslims!"
 ME_Delhi_Events.14.opt1: "That would be nothing short of suicide"

 ME_Delhi_Events.15.t: "The Rajput Coalition"
 ME_Delhi_Events.15.d: "The Delhi Sultanate has been making entry Rajput lands and appears to be closing in on our nation, causing a stir in the local Rajputs. The Mewari leader has proposed a brand coalition against the Delhi sultanate to free Rajputana of any Indian"
 ME_Delhi_Events.15.opt1: "Submit to Rajputana"
 ME_Delhi_Events.15.opt2: "We accept the King as our suzerain"
 ME_Delhi_Events.15.opt3: "We fight with the Rajputs!"
 ME_Delhi_Events.15.opt4: "That would be nothing short of suicide"

 ME_Delhi_Events.14.t: "Rana Sanga"
 ME_Delhi_Events.14.d: ""
 ME_Delhi_Events.14.opt1: "He must lead us!"
 ME_Delhi_Events.14.opt1: "His expertise is better off on the field"
