 fer_estensi_ferrara_title: "Estensi di Ferrara"
 fer_estensi_ferrara_desc: "The city of Ferrara rises on the banks of the Po di Volano, in the lower Emilian plain. This magnificent city has preserved intact over the centuries the great prestige it acquired during the Este era. It is in fact to the Este family that we owe the ambitious urban project (called Addizione Erculea) which transformed Ferrara from a medieval citadel into a real Renaissance work. The great cultural season of the Este family began in 1391 with the foundation of the University and grew to the point of bringing the Este Court to the highest European levels."
 fer_imperial_fiefdom_title: "Imperial Fiefdom"

 fer_military_campaign_title: "Military Campaign"
 fer_military_campaign_desc: "As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round [Root.Monarch.GetName], a curios conversation began. The marshals began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side."
 fer_conquest_venetia_title: "Conquest of Venetia"
 fer_conquest_venetia_desc: "The sun was already westering as they rode from Mantova, and the light of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Veneto to a golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, aid this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the Alps loomed, even darker and taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind."
 fer_trading_venice_title: "Trading in Venice"
 fer_trading_venice_desc: "The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the man from the lagoon. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, and still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the canals gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. In the St Mark's square the host of our horses roared like a sea, swarmed about its feet from end to end. Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Mercenaries sprang up them like apes in the dark forest of the South. Before the Cathedral's door the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on."

 fer_ward_save_title: "Ward Save"
 fer_ward_save_desc: "The Estensi policy was a tenacious and careful defense of a continuous balance between the neighboring powers: the Republic of Venice, Milan, [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and the papal possessions.

 fer_plains_emilia_title: "Plains of Emilia"
 fer_plains_emilia_desc: "With astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round. Soon the companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen moving  in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. Without a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had guns in hand, and their fingers were already fitted to the trigger. The one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed."
 fer_po_valley_title: "The Po Valley"
 fer_po_valley_desc: "The day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At last they saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Alps. Down the hillside the younglings, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. One the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud."
 fer_gonzaga_ruling_title: "Gonzaga's Ruling"
 fer_gonzaga_ruling_desc: "The Gonzagas were not only collectors of important works of art. They also engaged in the breeding of horses (the "Mantuan Berbers"), for entertainment and for wars, since the fifteenth century. Many of these animals were immortalized by various painters in the halls of their palaces (including the Sala dei Cavalli in Palazzo Te). The family was famous for the wealth of books contained in their libraries, many of which dealt with zoology and botany."
 fer_lombardo_veneto_title: "Lombardo Veneto"
 fer_lombardo_veneto_desc: "It was a deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. Mist of shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings and a murmur like voices passing. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lighting far away across the Valley, Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed."

 fer_papal_state_title: "The Papal State"

 fer_santa_maria_porto_desc: "Maria Portuensium Mater et Ravennatum Protectrix.\nA very different point of arrival was finally the Pala Portuense (1479-1481), for the church of Santa Maria in Porto near Ravenna, where the expressionistic tensions are relegated to some bas-reliefs on the base of the throne of the Virgin, while the general sentiment it is accorded to a calm and balanced harmony, with symmetrical correspondences in the colors. However, everything is also enlivened by the dizzying architecture of the throne, which leaves room for an open panorama at the base (which alludes to the mythical foundation of the church) with columns where the marble is rendered with extraordinary luministic sensitivity."
 fer_war_lombardy_title: "War in Lombardy"
 fer_war_lombardy_desc: "As they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of the Golenali forest loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Lombard, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrow sticking in back or throat. At last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. War is coming."
 fer_fall_visconti_title: "Fall of Visconti"
 fer_fall_visconti_desc: "Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and darts and other gears of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a Lombard officer's head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears. The last vestiges of the Visconti are no more, the remnants of their armies run shattered in the fields outside the cities seeking for salvation from the horse lord of Mantua."
 fer_curunir_lan_title: "Curunír 'Lân"
 fer_curunir_lan_desc: "Even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. Then there was a crash and a flash and smoke. The waters of the Deeping-stream poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in."
 fer_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"

Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 desc_fer_berberi_mantovani: "The first records of horse breeding date back to the middle of the 15th century at the time of Marquis Ludovico III Gonzaga, who intended to use them for Palio and tournaments, entering into competitions with the great Medici, Estensi and Farnese families of the time. Marquis Francesco II Gonzaga, a proud breeder who owned 125 horses at the end of the 15th century, called his Berber horses 'la raza nostra de casa'. Already in the 16th century, the marquises of Mantua were considered the best breeders in Europe. Horses for tournaments, racing, draught and transport were bred in Mantua. But it was the racehorses that were held in such high esteem that the King of England, Henry VIII, asked Federico II Gonzaga for some specimens. Arabian horses, which the Gonzagas bought directly in Spain through their trusted breeders as early as the beginning of the 16th century, were much appreciated and sought after for their breeding."

 desc_fer_tempi_arte: "It was above all Ercole I d'Este who implemented an ambitious urban planning project, a true doubling of the city based on rational principles, entrusting its realisation to the architect Biagio Rossetti. The projects started in 1484 following the siege of Ferrara by the Republic of Venice. The initial motivations were essentially defensive, expanding the city area within the walls (the Baluardo del Barco is one of the most archaic examples of modern fortification), but the project did not lack an urban vision linked to the concept of the ideal city and a realisation of Ercole's aspirations, linked to his training at the court of Naples, where he had learned to love classical architecture and art."
