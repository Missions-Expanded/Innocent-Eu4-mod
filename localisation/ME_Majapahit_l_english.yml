 MAJ_sunda_title: "Legacy of the Wedding"
 MAJ_sunda_desc: "The Kingdoms of Majapahit and Sunda considered each other to be equals, even during the exponential rise of Majapahit. That changed, when Gajah Mada, under the cover of an equal marriage, tried to subdue the Sundanese Royalty by making the princess a concubine of Majapahit's Raja instead. The resentment still lies in the Sundanese."
 MAJ_naval_prowess_title: "Naval Prowess"
 MAJ_naval_prowess_desc: "Majapahit is an empire cradled by the serene, embracing seas. It is no doubt then, that our prowess in the naval game is all but insignificant. In fact, over the centuries, we have adopted and pioneered many vessel types so as to optimize our ships on the waters."
 MAJ_secure_spice_trade_title: "Secure the Spices"

 MAJ_bedil_title: "Javan Bedil"

 MAJ_cetbangs_title: "Thunderous Cetbangs"
 MAJ_cetbangs_desc: "Cetbang is the artillery of Java, and, therefore, Majapahit Empire as well. In fact, over the centuries we have introduced our own version of the cannon, produced in our own, eastern style."
 MAJ_settling_nusa_title: "Settle Nusa Tenggara"
 MAJ_settling_nusa_desc: "In the past times, Majapahit Empire used to have tributaries in the Nusa Tenggara, but they fell from grace.

 MAJ_javan_relevancy_title: "Restore Javan Supremacy"

 MAJ_great_works_desc: "Each consecutive great kingdom in East Java constructed a great monument to show their wealth and strength off.

 MAJ_borneo_title: "Borneo Tributaries"
 MAJ_borneo_desc: "Our network of tributaries in Kalimantan has nothing but shattered, with the only one we are barely holding onto being Banjar. The vast Majapahit network of tributaries must be restored, especially in Borneo which is in the centre of the Archipelago."
 MAJ_berune_title: "Rein in Berune"
 MAJ_berune_desc: "During our decline, the unruly subject in Berune has broken off from our yoke! We must return them to our custody and show them who is the 'Empire on the rise' here!"
 MAJ_tanjungnagara_title: "Tanjungnagara"
 MAJ_tanjungnagara_desc: "The Majapahit name for Kalimantan is derived from the Tanjungpura kingdom, which once ruled the southwestern portion of Borneo.

 MAJ_majapahit_title: "Wilwatikta and Nusantara"

 MAJ_candi_title: "Reconnect the Candi"

The oath of Gajah Mada is still relevant to this day and we shall be cherished in our hearts."
 MAJ_tributaries_title: "Western Tributaries"
 MAJ_tributaries_desc: "The loss of the tributaries has hit the Majapahit economy hard. With no trade ensured, our trade deals of past cannot be renewed and our economy is having a serious hit. It is time to take matters into our hands, and to restore power in the West."
 MAJ_swarnadwipa_title: "Suvarnadvipa"

 MAJ_sakasanusa_title: "Sakasanusa"
 MAJ_sakasanusa_desc: "While the characteristics of the archipelago are similar, physically it would seem that Sulawesi differs greatly from the others. The island is quite mountaineous and the peaks reach quite high. Not only that, but it also has a peculiar shape and an ideal spot, which makes this Pillar Island a strategic asset."
 MAJ_maluku_title: "Control the Maluku"
 MAJ_maluku_desc: "The Maluku islands are key to manipulating the trade market. Home to vast Nutmeg and Cloves plantations, the islands are famous for the spices they produce. As such, subjugation and centralization of those territories would benefit us greatly."
 MAJ_temasek_title: "Punish Temasek"
 MAJ_temasek_desc: "The unruly city of Temasek is like a weed that does not go away. Having annihilated the city, its king founded a new state in Malacca and proceeded to become a major power in the region. It is outrageous that they have the audacity to rival us."
 MAJ_hujung_medini_title: "Hujung Medini"
 MAJ_hujung_medini_desc: "Hujung Medini refers to the northern border of the Majapahit Empire, that is the Malay Peninsula. Unfortunately, the usage of the term might be in danger, for our control over the area has been in severe decline. Time to restore our control over the Golden Peninsula!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.1.t: "The Moon of Majapahit Wanes"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.1.d: "Rocked by internal strife, constant succession issues, and rise of new rivals, the Majapahit Empire is not doing resoundingly good. The old realm forged by the courageous Kings of old and the most honorable Mahapatih Gajah Mada seems not to be able to stand the test of time. Shaken by new challenges and the emergence of new religion in the realm, as well as the changing balance of power, it is bound to collapse if something is not done!"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.1.a: "Something must be done!"
 #Just like the moon, each empire has its phases. First empires rise out of seemingly nowhere, they reach their full moon, and they enter a period of decline. It is such a period that we are in currently, but unlike other empires, we might enter a new period of glory.

 ME_Majapahit_Events.2.t: "Reversing the Decline"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.2.d: "Our survival is nothing short of miraculous. Grinded by pressuring internal strife and in constant succession issues, with policies much too old for the world we were facing, we managed to somehow reverse our fall. With the right actions, we were able to bring stability back to our economy, resolve the issue of highly autonomous dukes, tie the family back together, deal with the foreign merchants, and project our power outwards. Future looks bright for Majapahit!"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.2.a: "We prevail!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.3.t: "Support of the Demak Merchants"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.3.d: "Over the course of few decades, a community of muslim traders has begun forming in the coastal city of Demak. That was of little concern to the state until now. The most wealthy of those merchants have approached us with an irresistible offer. They are willing to help us on the economic side, in exchange for favors and guarantees. Should we accept?"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.3.a: "An irresistible offer indeed."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.3.b: "That would bring downfall!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.4.t: "Demak Secedes"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.4.d: "Our failure to establish suzerainty over our dukes and the subsequent rise of independent muslim duchies within our realm has lead to this day. The most powerful of muslim dukes has declared independence and took the area surrounding Demak, as well as all muslim provinces of our with him."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.4.a: "We have met a sinister fate."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.5.t: "Local Aristocracy Converts in [Majapahit_Target.GetName]"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.5.d: "Due to our inability to enforce national laws and our authority, the local Governor in [Majapahit_Target.GetName] felt it would be more beneficial if they were to convert to Sunni. Disastrous!"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.5.a: "They will meet their fate..."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.6.t: "Infighting in [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.6.d: "While relations in the [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] are usually good or at the very least lukewarm, recently they had taken a much sharper turn. How can the aristocracy put trust in such an unstable family?"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.6.a: "Nothing out of the ordinary..."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.7.t: "A Powerful Contender"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.7.d: "Seems like someone has had enough with us. The local Adipati in [Majapahit_Target.GetName] has rallied their retinue and support and decided to march against the capital! We will not let [Root.GetMonarch] be overthrown!"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.7.a: "They will pay the most costly of the prices!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.8.t: "Rise of an Adipati"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.8.d: "One of our governors, motivated by their meteoric rise to relevance, has decided to declare independence from our rule. While the adipati alone isn't enough to put a dent in our power, they are however diminishing our authority."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.8.a: "Disloyal Scoundrel!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.9.t: "Attempt on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Life"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.9.d: "The world seems to be against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Crippling infighting in the loyal family, little faith in the throne and lack of authority are just few things that are plaguing the leadership of the nation. Recently, assassination has become another concern, for a conspiracy to end [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s life has been unravelled."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.9.a: "Let us hope we rooted it all out."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.10.t: "A Sense of Separatism"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.10.d: "Due to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s weak rule and powerful governors, the aristocracy in [Majapahit_target.GetName] has been looking for a reason to secede. Their intentions must be stopped!"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.10.a: "One does not simply secede."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.11.t: "Little Authority"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.11.d: "Even our ancient tributaries have taken notice of our weaknesses. Motivated by our rapid decline, the subjects we have once taken for granted are looking to expand their influence."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.11.a: "We should have never trusted them."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.12.t: "The Tax Collectors"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.12.d: "Having restored our legitimacy, the authority of state-mandated tax collectors is finally respected again. No longer do the aristocrats oppose and do treasonous acts towards the representatives of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s will."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.12.a: "Great News!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.13.t: "Reintegration of a Province"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.13.d: "A province that once rebelled during our period of weakness, convinced by the authority of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], has once again submitted to our will, having brought forth gifts to [Root.Monarch.GetName] itself."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.13.a: "It's good to be a king."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.14.t: "Stability Amongst Chaos"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.14.d: "While the outward parts of the country might be in entropy, the inner parts of the country, the Negara Agung, is enjoying a more prosperous time.

 ME_Majapahit_Events.16.t: "Faith Abandoned"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.16.d: "[Root.GetName] has become a battlefield between two religions. With the tensions rising and much of the Hindu aristocracy being in open warfare against the muslim conversions, it is no surprise that the choice to convert to Islam has been an unpopular one."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.16.a: "Time of Change blows."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.100.t: "The Sundanese Succession"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.100.d: "With the Sundanese State vassalized, they cannot object to the proposal of a marriage. Just like Gajah Mada done in the past, it is time to stage a marriage which will essentially mean that [SUN.GetName] bends the knee."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.100.a: "We are stronger together."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.100.b: "Their dynasty will make up for good advisors!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.101.t: "Selling Firearms"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.101.d: "As the successors to the Majapahit Empire, it is their traditions of weaponsmithing that we inherited. We can use those techniques to forge new kinds of firearms, and to gain an edge above other polities. Furthermore, should we wish, we can also make business with them. Should we sell our firearms?"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.101.a: "Naturally, [Majapahit_Target_1.GetName] will give us the best price."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.101.b: "We will bestow the chance upon [Majapahit_Target_2.GetName]."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.101.c: "We shall partner with [Majapahit_Target_3.GetName]."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.101.e: "Remind me, why should we sell our firearms?"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.102.t: "At the Edge of the Empire"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.102.d: "At last, we have finally arrived and subjugated the lands that once were the frontiers of the empire. These lands used to be the powerbase of a state rival to ours, should we bestow honors upon them, and make their city our secondary capital, or should their wealth be brought to [Capital.GetName]?"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.102.a: "The wealth belongs in [Capital.GetName]."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.102.b: "Secondary capital will do just fine."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.103.t: "A Marriage Proposal"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.103.d: "Back in the days of yore, during the times of Gajah Mada, we made a marriage proposal to the Kingdom of Sunda, a state we considered equal to ours, despite our immense growth in power. Our friends in Sunda have complied, but were ultimately betrayed by our ancestors. It is time we reconcile with the Sundanese."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.103.a: "Send the messengers!"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.103.b: "There is no way they will accept."

 ME_Majapahit_Events.104.t: "Day of Reconciliation"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.104.d: "The Majapahit has offered us a marriage proposal, back like the one centuries past. Last time it was a trap, but this time they have given us a gift and are wishing to reconcile with us."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.104.a: "We will accept."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.104.b: "This is another trap!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.105.t: "The Fate of Sunda"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.105.d: "The day is come, the monarch of [SUN.GetName] has perished, and as per our agreement, we may choose to integrate the brotherly kingdom into our domain. Question is though, should we?"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.105.a: "The time is for integration."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.105.b: "We should focus on other things right now!"

 ME_Majapahit_Events.106.t: "A Tempting Offer"
 ME_Majapahit_Events.106.d: "Our friends over at [From.GetName] have offered us an offer to purchase firearms from them. Such equipment could give us a significant edge in the battles to come."
 ME_Majapahit_Events.106.a: "Excellent proposal!"
