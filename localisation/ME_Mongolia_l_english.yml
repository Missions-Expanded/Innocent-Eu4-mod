 # Missions:
 kha_timurids_title: "Heartland of the Timurids"
 kha_timurids_desc: "Timur had noble ambitions, but was inevitably too weak to restore what was. Truly, a Mongol Empire can only emerge from Mongolia. We would do well to teach them this."
 kha_uzbek_title: "Conquer Uzbek"
 kha_uzbek_desc: "Following our path of traditional conquest, the Uzbek nomads lie in our path. They present both a roadblock and a challenge to overcome. They may be united, but so are we."
 kha_nogai_title: "Conquer Nogai"
 kha_nogai_desc: "Nogai, just as with the Uzbek, was traditionally part of our empire and thus must be reintegrated. They present little threat, therefore we may tread lightly."
 kha_mongol_people_title: "Unify the Mongol People"
 kha_mongol_people_desc: "Our century-old rampage left a scattered populace of Mongol peoples with little contact with one another. We even hear stories of a Mongol splinter residing in Anatolia, though we cannot be certain. In the meantime, we should deal with the Great Horde, one of the few legitimate successors to the Golden Horde, which is, in turn, a legitimate successor to our Grand Empire. All shall be well once more."
 kha_crimea_title: "Attack Crimea"
 kha_crimea_desc: "The Crimeans are another group of Mongol origin. We must continue our reconquests and reintegrate them as well."
 kha_prepare_title: "Prepare for Independence"
 kha_prepare_desc: "A far cry from the Mongol Empire, we have regressed to the point of servitude to our Oirat overlords. The Oirats may have significantly more power than us, but we possess a strength of will akin to that of the Great Khans, and thus we shall inevitably prevail in the upcoming independence struggle. Until then, we must prepare."
 kha_independence_title: "Independence"
 kha_independence_desc: "We have rallied the tribes. Each has contributed a substantial force of cavalry and infantrymen, leading us to believe we are united and prepared for an extended conflict. We need only provoke a conflict."
 kha_past_title: "Overcome the Past"
 kha_past_desc: "We may yet emerge from this downward spiral of national decline and despair, stemming from the calamity of collapse. Strength of will shall surpass the strength of arms once more, as it did hundreds of years ago."
 kha_unite_chagatai_title: "Unite the Chagatayids"
 kha_unite_chagatai_desc: "The Chagatai Khanate, though remaining intact, has devolved into numerous squabbling tribes, and thus it is unfit for self-governance. We should reintegrate them into our empire to ensure their survival alongside ours. Strength in numbers and strength in kin."
 kha_yarkand_and_yogir_title: "Yarkand and Yogir"
 kha_yarkand_and_yogir_desc: "Though we despise betrayal, we hold survival in high regard. Upon the collapse of the Empire, several groups fled the nation, relegating themselves unto a fate either within foreign borders or creating a newfound sense of independence. Nevertheless, now that our turmoil is at its end, we should reintegrate these groups."
 kha_yuan_title: "Return of the Yuan"
 kha_yuan_desc: "The Great Khanate, also known as the Yuan Dynasty, recently fell to the Neo-Confucianist Ming Dynasty, which scorched their own history by removing any sense of Mongol culture within all of China. Back then, we conquered China in just 70 years. From the brink of collapse, we brought ourselves back and, in an even more impressive show of power, managed it in even less time. We must now prove our legitimacy."
 kha_beijing_title: "Restore Beijing"
 kha_beijing_desc: "The old capital, when the Great Khanate split off, Beijing was taken with it. Now, it resides in Han-Chinese hands. We cannot let this disgrace continue."
 kha_yangtze_title: "Control the Yangtze"
 kha_yangtze_desc: "Historically, our father seized control of the entire Yangtze river with the control of two cities. This had pushed back Ming drastically, now that they no longer had control of the longest river in the world for supplies and funds. We ought to do the same."
 kha_seize_empire_title: "Seize the Empire"
 kha_seize_empire_desc: "The Ming can hardly be called an empire, thus we shall strip them of the title. Our advance will be swift, and the Great Khanate shall rise once more."
 kha_oceans_title: "Empire of Two Oceans"
 kha_oceans_desc: "Upon our furthest extent, we heard tales of another ocean, lying west, beyond the endless stepped, and even beyond the Franks. We would do well to find this ocean and see it with our own eyes."
 kha_russia_title: "Ravage Russia"
 kha_russia_desc: "The Muscovites betrayed us and cannot be forgiven. We must invade immediately to teach them the most important lesson of all: the world is cyclical, and their destruction shall come once again."
 kha_korchin_title: "Subjugate Korchin"
 kha_korchin_desc: "The Mongol tribe of Korchin and surrounding lands used to be in union with the Mongol Empire. Now, they stand divided and helpless against Chinese aggression. We shall bestow mercy and reintegrate them."
 kha_manchus_title: "Overpower the Manchus"
 kha_manchus_desc: "Consisting of Mongols, the Manchus rightly belong under our protection. The day we cannot provide that protection is the day we fail as a nation."
 kha_steppe_life_title: "Life in the Steppes"
 kha_steppe_life_desc: "Life in the steppes has always been hard and tumultuous. There lies no grace between scorching summer that makes up a fourth of the year and a harshly freezing winter that makes up the rest. One solace remains: our horses provide our way of life, and we cannot neglect them."
 kha_neglect_title: "Shamanist Benign Neglect"
 kha_neglect_desc: "We need no state religion, nor standardized worship. Other nations may find use for these establishments, but in all honesty, Mongolia is better without them. We were known far and wide for our policy of tolerance during the glory days, which will repeat once more."
 kha_unite_tengri_title: "Unite the Shamanists"
 kha_unite_tengri_desc: "Beneath the infinite sky, known by many as Tengri, lies those who worship the blue expanse that provides all life in this world. We must unite the people who see this light for what it truly is."
 kha_return_of_the_golden_horde_title: "Return of the Golden Horde"
 kha_return_of_the_golden_horde_desc: "With grand ambitions come hurdles that must be leaped over, and milestones to guide the way. Out of the four Khanates that emerged from the Mongol Empire, the Great Horde kept our lifestyle in mind and continued our ancient traditions of pastoralism. We would do well to realize their glory before our own."

 KHA_SECONDARY_RELIGION_BONUSES_TT: "If §YSunni§! is our syncretic faith, all §YSunni§! provinces owned by us receive §G-3§! unrest."
 KHA_SECONDARY_RELIGION_BONUSES_TT_NO_DLC: "All §YSunni§! provinces owned by us receive §G-3§! unrest."
 KHA_CAN_FORM_GOLDEN_HORDE_WITH_ALTAIC_CULTURE: "We will be able to form @GLH §Y[GLH.GetName]§!, if we are in the §YAltaic§! culture group."
 KHA_CHACHAR_PROVINCES_LOSE_NATIONALISM: "All provinces of the §YChachar§! culture gain §G-15§! years of nationalism."

 # Events:
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME1: "The Capital of Timur"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC1: "We have reached the capital of Tamerlane's Empire, or what it used to be. As of now it's nothing but a disembodied corpse that can show little resistance against us. We hold in our hands one of the most beautiful Muslim sites outside Arabia... and we could upon it."
 ME_Mongolia_Events1.EVTOPT1: "Here we will start our Muslim empire."
 ME_Mongolia_Events1.EVTOPT2: "Preposterous!"
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME3: "The Fate of our Past"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC3: "The Yuan dynasty has now risen anew, like a phoenix out of its ashes. But the past is something that we do not have power over, no matter how much we gallop through the prairies of time. We cannot change history, but we can change the way the future remembers it. We must choose a mindset from which to view the centuries to come."
 ME_Mongolia_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Do not deny it."
 ME_Mongolia_Events3.EVTOPT2: "We write history now."
 ME_Mongolia_Events3.EVTOPT3: "Let the people witness history as they see fit."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME4: "Qufu, the Holy Site of Confucianism"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC4: "In our conquest, we have thoughtlessly ravaged upon Qufu, the holy site and epicenter of Confucius's teachings. This school of thought believes that there is no heaven at all, yet its our duty as subjects of the Sky God to embrace all people and culture. A decision must be reached soon."
 ME_Mongolia_Events4.EVTOPT1: "This man's beliefs and ours are the same."
 ME_Mongolia_Events4.EVTOPT2: "They believe in no heaven, and no heaven shall be reserved for them."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME5: "The Ruins of Fuzimiao"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC5: "Fuzimiao used once to be the site of imperial examination, a place where only excellency and a fine mind could thrive. It was burnt down recently and with that, a great place has been lost to us completely. We could benefit from rebuilding this place... or plundering it as we keep advancing."
 ME_Mongolia_Events5.EVTOPT1: "Let us rebuild this place to its former glory!"
 ME_Mongolia_Events5.EVTOPT2: "Our money is better spent elsewhere."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME6: "Fuzimiao Rebuilt"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC6: "The Imperial Examination Center of Fuzimiao has been rebuilt. Their halls shall be decorated with the glory for millennia, and their tests shall be done under a [Root.GetAdjective] roof."
 ME_Mongolia_Events6.EVTOPT1: "We reap what we do not ravage."

 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME7: "The Question of Confucianism"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC7: "Our conquest has brought us many subjects who embrace all religions and beliefs as if they were one. Meanwhile while we accept everything under the blue sky, they make it part of themselves. In our ever going conquest, it would benefit us to harmonize this idea and the entire earth. All for the Tengri."
 ME_Mongolia_Events7.EVTOPT1: "Perhaps, sticking to our roots is for the best."
 ME_Mongolia_Events7.EVTOPT2: "Let's adopt their beliefs - and the whole world's."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME8: "Encountering Buddhism once again"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC8: "Our brothers held high the teachings of Buddha in their hearts, just as much as they upheld the laws of the Tengri. As we press to the south-west we are now surrounded by the former. Many have no qualms on going back, and in fact, it seems that this amounts to a great part of our population. While imprudent, the laws of Tengri do accept all religions under the sky."
 ME_Mongolia_Events8.EVTOPT1: "We should go back to our dynastic roots."
 ME_Mongolia_Events8.EVTOPT2: "We should know better than to abandon our faith so rashly."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME9: "Establishing a Dalai Lama"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC9: "We have been approached by a secret stranger who seems to have reached a higher plane of existence. His mind is not only naturally sharp, but his presence instills a fear different from the one we emit - one not only of fear and power but of respect and holiness. His proposal would've gotten him executed for foolishness, if not for this very aura: to unify Buddhism in one land."
 ME_Mongolia_Events9.EVTOPT1: "We shall unify this holy land."
 ME_Mongolia_Events9.EVTOPT2: "Why not name ourselves Dalai Lama?"
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME10: "Tibet United"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC10: "After many years, we have upheld our promise to Gyatso, [TIB.GetName] is united once again. But beyond these mountains lay lands unclaimed and away from our flag, our mission here is done and they are grateful, and they will follow us to the very ends of earth."
 ME_Mongolia_Events10.EVTOPT1: "Tibet shall help us envelop the world under the Dalai Lama."
 ME_Mongolia_Events10.EVTOPT2: "We shall fly the same banner."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME11: "Cultural Renaissance"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC11: "An unprecedented amount of knowledge has been pouring into our realm, originating from colossal amounts of knowledge from ancient Buddhist scriptures. We are on the very edge of a Renaissance, and we can decide how where it will be headed."
 ME_Mongolia_Events11.EVTOPT1: "Let's unite our people through our faith."
 ME_Mongolia_Events11.EVTOPT2: "Let's unite our knowledge through a common language."
 ME_Mongolia_Events11.EVTOPT3: "Let's spread our faith through the whole empire."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME12: "Tamerlane's Legacy"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC12: "As we head West we come across more people who whisper of the tale Tamerlane. A man who was neither a descendant of our great Khan and still claimed his name; and paradoxically, was not a descendant of Muhammad and still claimed to be a Caliph. No single man is sure what to consider him, and as the ones who are reuniting his lands, we must give a clear answer."
 ME_Mongolia_Events12.EVTOPT1: "Timur was a true Khan."
 ME_Mongolia_Events12.EVTOPT2: "Timur was a caliphate."
 
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTNAME13: "Our Muslim Subjects"
 ME_Mongolia_Events.EVTDESC13: "In the time of the four Khans, three of them embraced Islam as their faith. Even us, when we held the name of Yuan, brought in Muslim advisers and philosophers to help administrate our empire. As the number of believers increase, maybe we could use opening our minds a little."
 ME_Mongolia_Events13.EVTOPT1: "Accept Islam as a minority religion again."
 ME_Mongolia_Events13.EVTOPT2: "Religion is a secondary matter."
