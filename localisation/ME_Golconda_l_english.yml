 #Golconda Missions
 golconda_advised_where_to_go_title: "The Paths Ahead"
 golconda_advised_where_to_go_desc: "Golconda is at a crossroads: What path should we pursue? Conquest of our neighbors to grow our borders? Building projects for our many towns and cities? Or possibly even diplomatic endeavors for good alliances in the future? All of these possibilities are hard to process for just one singular head of Golconda's administration, which is why advisors will need to be employed regularly so that they can help decipher what path for Golconda is best. Their advice could very well lead Golconda into prosperous times and we should always be aiming for that."
 golconda_starting_builds_title: "Internal Spending"
 golconda_starting_builds_desc: "Our position as the inheritor of the lucrative mines of Golconda makes us valuable and coveted by many powers around us, but the wealth that is taken from deep within the dirt beneath us can be used to stop our enemies from taking over our lands. Sure we could do this through spending more on the military, but a more permanent solution would be something along the lines of promoting building projects so that tax revenue is increased and our cities become larger overall. A larger population pool to draw on and a bigger stream of coins coming into the treasury will surely benefit Golconda's defense and offense whenever either are needed."
 golconda_take_the_andhra_coast_title: "Toward Andhra's Coast"
 golconda_take_the_andhra_coast_desc: "Telugu communities lay scattered across the various parts of the Eastern Deccan and toward the coastal edge of the subcontinent, just north of the Tamil areas in the south. If we of Golconda could unite most if not all of the Telugu communities into one cohesive state and administration, we would be in a position of substanial power in terms of both projecting military power and influence through trade. It seems quite obvious then what our next objective is."
 golconda_reserves_ready_title: "Test Your Mettle"
 golconda_reserves_ready_desc: "The descent of the Sultanate of Bahmanis into the annals of history is sad to many in Golconda, but we must not dwell on the death of our predecessor for too long. Disunified are the successors of Bahmanis, but in time there will be a singular successor to the sultans who hailed from Bidar. We of Golconda need to prepare our military for when we are put forth our claim to be the next in line for succession to the old Bahmani legacy."
 golconda_the_capital_fort_title: "Golconda's Citadel"
 golconda_the_capital_fort_desc: "Lucrative are our lands but we are lacking in what seems to be proper fortifications. What we have right now, a crude mudbrick capital wall, is not going to be enough against courageous invading armies wielding muskets and cannons alike. Let us garner military engineers and workers alike so that we can design a proper citadel in which our most valued officials and families can be safe inside whilst the garrison fights valiantly against any would-be invader."
 golconda_centralize_further_title: "Enforced Edicts"
 golconda_centralize_further_desc: "The many laws and edicts we pass in the capital can often go unheard of in far off parts of Golconda, especially in places where we would like them followed most of all such as trade hubs and port cities. We should focus our efforts on building up road networks to relay information across our lands more quickly, and also we should be installing smart yet obedient officials throughout Golconda so that our laws are enforced locally as well as seen to have adequate legitimacy."
 OWNS_ALL_TELUGU_PROVINCES_IN_ASIA: "§O[This.GetName] must own all provinces in India of Telugu culture.§!"
 golconda_all_telegu_lands_title: "Scattered Family"
 golconda_all_telegu_lands_desc: "Though we have a great many Telugu communities in our own lands, there are still several towns and cities in the lands southeast of the Deccan Plateau that speak the Telugu language and share in our cultural history. Though some would point out that we, the ruling body of Golconda, are of Persian origin just like the Sultanate of Bahmanis was, we embrace the Telugu language and culture to a great extent and even our royal family is educated in the beautiful language and traditions that stretch back centuries. With these righteous Muslims leading the charge, the time has finally come to reunite these scattered familial pieces into one singular political entity."
 golconda_prominent_capital_title: "Unprecedented Growth"
 golconda_prominent_capital_desc: "The influx of wealth and prosperity to Golconda has had a number of effects on both the administration and society as a whole, though these changes are slow to make themselves known on a large scale. We should stop these changes now though, and we certainly should not stop the growing prosperity making its way throughout our land. Centralizing this new wealth and prosperity in our capital city and also the growing city of Hyderabad (located very close to Golconda itself) will help stabilize this upward trend instead of letting it spiral out of control."
 golconda_starting_textile_production_title: "Meet the Demands"
 golconda_starting_textile_production_desc: "As we continue to grow and prosper throughout the years, we are becoming more connected with overseas markets and also markets that are beyond cities like Delhi, Multan, and Dhaka. These places, like our own heartland, are growing in size and density and are demanding more foreign goods like silk clothing and dyed cloth. We of Golconda are prominent producers of those two things nad also many other resources and we can continue to make great amounts of money from these foreign cities via trade if and only if we are able to meet the increasing demands."
 golconda_monuments_title: "Immortalized Self"
 golconda_monuments_desc: "We stand at the precipice of greatness. Our once small nation covered by the ashes of the once burning Sultanate of Bahmanis has grown into a monumental empire the likes of which few could have ever dreamed of in the midst of the early 1500s. To complete our rise to prominence and to decorate our already illustrious crown, we shall begin constructing monuments to our own empire. Whether they are mosques, gardens, or tombs for our hallowed royal lineage, all of these delightfully prestigious structures we build will show our might and grandeur to the world at large."
 golconda_composite_state_title: "Composite State"
 golconda_composite_state_desc: "Being that we are situated in the vast subcontinent of Hindustan where Muslims are more of a ruling minority instead of a true majority like in Arabia or Persia, we must make compromises with Hindu locals when we govern and we must learn to be much more tolerant as time goes on. By incorporating more Hindus into our administration, respecting their rights when it comes to various ceremonies and places of worship, and treating them as equals throughout Golconda, we can cultivate state that can be described as 'composite' in nature. Golconda will truly become greater than the sum of its original parts."
 golconda_patronize_telegu_culture_title: "Open a New Chapter"
 golconda_patronize_telegu_culture_desc: "The sun has set on the previous period of Telugu literature being promoted by the old Vijayanagara Empire. Now the Telugu people are looking to Golconda and its administration for assistance in starting a new age of Telugu literature as many poets and scholars of Telugu heritage are beginning to make themselves known in our land. If we can prove to be stable enough and also wealthy enough to fund a grand and varied court structure, then Golconda can indeed become the new center of Telugu literature. We will also promote Persian literature as well in our court, but the Telugu people are our core people and deserve this renewed time in the sun."

 golconda_five_cities_five_successors_title: "Five Cities - Five States"
 golconda_five_cities_five_successors_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Sultanate of Bahmanis, we have been left to struggle and fight for an existence that seems almost doomed at times. We are not alone in this though, as there are other cities in the former Deccani state that have gained prominence and power amidst the collapse.\nAhmednagar, Berar, Bijapur, and Golconda, all have aspirations for reuniting the lands of Bahmanis into one whole state and the city of Bidar itself is also trying to make itself a standing political figure still. We must not delay our conquest nor become stagnant in this quickly shifting political climate; we must steady ourselves and strike when the times are right so that our safety and power is secured."
 golconda_the_battle_of_talikota_title: "Bulwark of the Deccan"
 golconda_the_battle_of_talikota_desc: "The largest threat to us as of now is the Hindu powers to the south, most notably the Vijayanagara Empire. Though the power of the Sultanate of Bahmanis is but a memory now, with the consolidation of the five key cities of the Deccan under our authority we can effectively push back the Hindu encroachment from the south. The legacy of our predecessor will not be tarnished so easily!"
 golconda_khandesh_and_vijayangara_title: "The Deccani Wars"
 golconda_khandesh_and_vijayangara_desc: "There is much to be gained through conquering the Deccan and its lucrative cities, bountiful fields, and productive mines. We are not alone in seeing this, however, as those in the north and south are still willing to challenge our hegemony over the region as a whole. Let us draw our sword and meet these foes in battle for we will have to wage not just one single war to win over what is rightfully ours, but multiple wars that will dictate the very future of our empire and the fate of millions of people on the subcontinent."
 golconda_unite_the_region_title: "Nizam-ul-Mulk"
 golconda_unite_the_region_desc: "What it means to be a good Nizam (roughly meaning 'governor') and leader of the Deccan is hard to nail down. So many facets are required to be a competent administrator alone, but the challenges of the Deccan such as cultural clashes and religious confluences make it so that a truly benevolent and just Nizam-ul-Mulk (roughly meaning 'Governor of the Realm') will be hard to come by. We must never cease in our endeavor to make this happen though, since controlling the entirety of the Deccan will challenge our administration and its primary leadership time and time again. Truly we must look toward building a stable and prosperous future under a rightful Nizam."
 golconda_chowmahalla_palace_title: "Chowmahalla Palace"
 golconda_chowmahalla_palace_desc: "With our conquests throughout the Deccan complete and our military still embarking on conquests in neighboring regions, there are some within our dynasty and administration who think it would do us well to have a proper seat of residence. One of the most nominated candidate cities for this is near Golconda. Now, Golconda is prosperous and valuable of course, but the burgeoning city of Hyderabad nearby does not experience as many water shortages and as such would be a fitting place for a new palace of great detail and prestige. In time, as we plan out this new palace for our dynasty, we can formulate it into an administrative center of sorts, but that will only be in conjunction with it being the crowning achievement to our long line of conquests."
