 ME_Circassia_Events.1.d: "Our Father, Holy Resident Above,\nFor which the world is merely but a truss,\nSends forth an Angel, come forth Holy Dove.\nWhat white wonder this bird doth sing to us.\n\nYet for granted taketh we its dear song.\nOur Father knows our pain, for He sees all.\nAnd prayers He answers, each man a throng.\nThen two sabers doth come forth as we bawl.\n\nOnce again, these sabers grew a burden\nUpon our weary and bereaved shoulders.\nThus the Lord giveth parchment for the scribe,\nYet our backs could not support these boulders.\n\nThe Lord bringeth forth, man taketh away.\nEach holy gift, each fades unto the gray."
