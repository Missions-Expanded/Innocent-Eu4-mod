 # Missions:
 hormuz_omani_roots_title: "Omani Roots"
 hormuz_omani_roots_desc: "Our Kingdom was established long ago, by a member of the Omani royal court. Despite our close ties with the house of Nabhan, times are dire and our enemies are encroaching on our gates. In order to secure our legitimacy and expand our influence, Oman must perish!"
 hormuz_masters_of_arabia_title: "Masters of Arabia"
 hormuz_masters_of_arabia_desc: "Power awaits no man in his pursuit of fame and glory. Let us act decisively and swiftly as we campaign in Arabia. We shall force the tribes of our region on their knees and use their resources to elevate our kingdom to never-before-seen heights of glory and legend!"
 hormuz_arad_fort_title: "Arad Fort" 
 hormuz_arad_fort_desc: "One of the most vital forts in the entirety of Arabia, the Arad Fort is located on the island of Awal. Used time and again to stop besiegers and save its ruling dynasty, it proved an invaluable piece of defense against all manner of ambitious conquerors. However, despite its importance under the Al-Holuf, it has caved in to the withering touch of time. It befalls us to restore it to its former greatness!"
 hormuz_control_the_straits_title: "Control the Straits"
 hormuz_control_the_straits_desc: "The vast wealth that once flowed through the Persian straits may once again be restored. Such an undertaking is surely vast, yet we once were the masters of exotic goods and traders of fortunes, and we will be so again. The first step to re-establishing ourselves as the dominant power in the Gulf will be to build a formidable force."
 hormuz_retake_mogostan_title: "Retake Mogostan"
 hormuz_retake_mogostan_desc: "Our old capital, situated in the city of Mogostan now lies in foreign hands. We cannot stand this insolence, of a city that used to be our jewel at the Persian coast, at the hands of foreigners and barbarians." 
 hormuz_gateway_to_india_title: "Gateway to India" 
 hormuz_gateway_to_india_desc: "Beyond the desolate edges of the Chagai mountains, lies the entrance to one of the most lush and fertile lands ever seen by the eye of any man, India. Home to spices and exoctic goods, the continent exports much of its wealth into our shores. The first step to reaching such a continent is the deserts of Makran." 
 hormuz_the_gulf_coast_title: "The Gulf Coast" 
 hormuz_the_gulf_coast_desc: "The coast along the northern Persian Golf is rightfully under our jurisdiction as keepers of the straits. To secure their wealth and maritime importance under our banner will play a vital role in elevating us to a regional power."
 hormuz_seek_religious_unity_title: "Seek Religious Unity" 
 hormuz_seek_religious_unity_desc: "Our country is torn between the three religious factions that are struggling for power. Whilst most of our people follow the Ibadi and Shia teachings, our royalty and Ulema remain firmly loyal to the teachings of  Sunni Islam. It would be wise to choose a set course and attempt to rectify the religious relations between our people, be it via tolerance and enforcement of the True Faith." 
 hormuz_regulate_mercantile_commodities_title: "Regulate Trade Commodities" 
 hormuz_regulate_mercantile_commodities_desc: "The Indian subcontinent is home to a vast array of exotic goods of great value. Let us cooperate with our merchants in an effort to increase the profit by state-sponsored ventures and mercantile practices. Such moves will surely generate much-needed profit that may help fund future campaigns or internal infrastructure."
 hormuz_hormuzi_tradition_title: "Hormuzi Tradition" 
 hormuz_hormuzi_tradition_desc: "Our nation is founded upon the principles of maritime expeditions and mercantile risks. Once a band of raiders and cutthroats, these shores took care of our people, allowing us to prosper and profit in the process. As the tides of time move forward, we must make sure we secure the cornerstones of our growing kingdom lest we fall pray to our enemies."

 #Events
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTNAME1: "Fate of the House of Nabhan" 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTDESC1: "Established in 1154, the royal lineage of the Nabhani ruled over the western tip of the Persian straits. Famous for their wealth, they controlled the valuable trade of frankincense from the old coasts of Masqat through the Arabian deserts of Sohar. The fate of a brotherly House is in our hands, and the way we choose to deal with such an enormous matter may yet influence our fate and the future of our own people." 
 ME_Hormuz_Events1.EVTOPT1: "Their men of faith will be of great use." 
 ME_Hormuz_Events1.EVTOPT2: "Let us reunite our Houses!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events1.EVTOPT3: "We will make an example of them."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTNAME2: "Proper Interpretation of Islamic Teachings"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTDESC2: "Dire times have withered the faith of our people by spreading false teachings that go against the Sunni scriptures of our forefathers. Despite that, many amongst the peasantry have not only embraced Ibadi teachings but also plea with local men of state to do so as well.\nClassical Ibadi theologians have stated that only the ahl al-istiqamah will go to paradise, and that all sinning Ibadis as well as all non-Ibadis will burn in hell forever. Ibadis traditionally reject Sunni beliefs that all Muslims in hell will eventually enter paradise, and hold that hell is eternal and inescapable for all humans who were not righteous Ibadis in life. Whatever branch of Islam we decide to follow, our conviction needs to be strong and our faith unshakable, lest we betray Allah and fall pray on our enemies."
 ME_Hormuz_Events2.EVTOPT1: "Ibadi scholars speak of the truth!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events2.EVTOPT2: "We can't abandon the teachings of Sunnism!" 
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTNAME3: "The Fate of our Kingdom"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTDESC3: "Flavor text about the roots and beginnings of the Kingdom of Hormuz, their pirate past versus their current status as guardians of the straits and famous as well as profitable traders."
 ME_Hormuz_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Let us reignite the burning passion for plunder in our hearts!" 
 ME_Hormuz_Events3.EVTOPT2: "Our future lies with our maritime activities"
