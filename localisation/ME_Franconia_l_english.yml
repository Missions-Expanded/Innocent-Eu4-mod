 # Generic Franconian Missions:
 FKN_build_an_army_title: "Fränkische Armee"
 FKN_build_an_army_desc: "Our aim is to achieve the unification of the duchies and bishoprics making up Franconia. Building up an army would help maintain our borders and expand into new lands. The future of Franconia depends on our willingness to take action, and therefore we must make sure we have enough forcess to do so!"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_title: "Keine Freien Städte Mehr"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_desc: "The city-state of Nuremburg is well defended; a great fortress makes up the exterior of the city itself. To control it will be a difficult task, that is no trick. Still, with proper execution of newly developed siege techniques, the walls of Nuremburg can be overcome, and we can use the vast fortress for our own purposes!"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_title: "Ecclesiastical Control"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_desc: "The Bishoprics of Wurzburg and Bamberg claim to be protected by God, but God alone will not save them from us. Their influence in Franconian politics is too big to go unchecked, so we have to make sure they are out of the picture before they become diplomatically dominant over the region."
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_title: "Subjugate the Margraves"
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_desc: "The House of Hohenzollern rules the quaint Duchy of Ansbach, and as such they have dynastic ties to Brandenburg, a far greater power than us. Their state is set to be under union with Brandenburg once their ruler dies, and so if we don't act fast we'll have to deal with a union. For the continued autonomy of Franconia, Ansbach must be eliminated."
 FKN_unifying_franconia_title: "Unifying Franconia"
 FKN_unifying_franconia_desc: "The time has finally come to unite the old Franconian Duchy of Charlemagne once again. The unification process has taken a toll on our men, our lands, our culture, and maybe even our faith. We have faced many foes, from the Austrians and Bavarians, to the Swabians and Westphalians. So with all the hardships overcome by our will, we can finally say Three Hurrahs for Franconia!"
 FKN_dux_francorum_title: "Dux Francorum"
 FKN_dux_francorum_desc: "For years, the Franconian people have been divided within the petty duchies of the Holy Roman Empire, and have started to lose their morale for a united Franconia. No longer shall our people be separated, and we can only enforce this by uniting the Franconian lands."
 FKN_strength_in_unity_title: "Strength in Unity"
 FKN_strength_in_unity_desc: "In order to mend this shattered empire, we must first start on a smaller scale. By uniting with our brothers we might stand a chance at greater prospects."
 FKN_recognition_of_emperor_title: "Zustimmung des Kaisers"
 FKN_recognition_of_emperor_desc: "One cannot survive in the Empire without certain privileges. Whereas a European king answeres to naught but the Lord, we are subject to an earthly power's whims. The autonomy we do enjoy is provided by the Emperor... we would do well to stay in their good graces."
 FKN_growing_cities_title: "Accodomate the Cities"
 FKN_growing_cities_desc: "A duchy is merely the product of its subsidiary cities. Nowhere does this hold truer than in Germany, a region of rich history and culture. The cities provide all that we need to govern; we should keep them on a short leash with a steady hand."
 FKN_raubritter_title: "Deal with the Raubritter"
 FKN_raubritter_desc: "Men of great pedigree, by nature, hold great influence within Franconia. A disloyal nobility does not bode well for a nation, and we are no exception. For the duchy to run smoothly, these important landowners must have their appetite for power sated, at least temporarily. The support of the Raubritter shall serve us well."
 FKN_bavaria_title: "Against the Goliath"
 FKN_bavaria_desc: "To our south lies perhaps the most powerful of the Imperial Princes. The Bavarians have exerted their influence over us since time immemorial, making them the most pertinent threat to our political independence. The invasion shall begin soon, let our first strike be the last."
 FKN_saxony_title: "Across the Frankenwald"
 FKN_saxony_desc: "Man's tendency to dictate borders via geography certainly has its merits. The northern border with Saxony lies along the Frankenwald hills, which will be troublesome to attack across. Regardless, our army fears no mountain, much less a few petty hills. The Saxons shall know the taste of Franconian steel."
 FKN_west_franconia_title: "Ancestral Rights"
 FKN_west_franconia_desc: "As the claimants to the ancient Duchy of Franconia, we have a duty to the restoration of the duchy as a major player in the empire. This means expanding our borders to match those of our ancestral lands, which constitutes westward expansion into Electorate territory."
 FKN_capture_berlin_title: "Capture Berlin"
 FKN_capture_berlin_desc: "The Northern Wars with the Saxons have gone on long enough. We shall march across the March as Brandenburg watched helplessly, Franconian boots trampling their once great city. With this final attack, our main rival shall fall, and the strongest of the German peoples shall reign supreme."
 FKN_westphalia_title: "Saxon Stem Duchy"
 FKN_westphalia_desc: "The Saxons have huffed their last breath as our net is cast over the North German peoples. The eastern duchies have fallen, we must now see to the west and restore the Duchy of Saxony as a subservient entity."
 FKN_swabia_title: "Swabian Stem Duchy"
 FKN_swabia_desc: "Our southern flank has been somewhat secured after the fall of Bavaria, but we cannot rest on our laurels. The Swabians pose a significant threat. For the glory of Franconia, Swabia must fall, then rise once more under our banner."
 FKN_reformation_title: "Reformation in Franconia"
 FKN_reformation_desc: "The cardinals of Rome see fit to govern the spirit of Franconia. Whilst we pay fealty to a master, that master is not the Pope. The old man should stay out of our political affairs, and through reformation shall it happen, one way or another."
 FKN_bettenberger_taffelrunde_title: "Bettenberger Tafelrunde"
 FKN_bettenberger_taffelrunde_desc: "Our nation serves as a bastion of free thought for all of Germany, with intellectuals stifled by aristocratic greed. We should do well to establish a true round table for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], where each member may speak freely without fear of execution. Such an advisory board will catapult Franconian free thought into the modern era."
 FKN_estates_title: "Fränkische Stände"
 FKN_estates_desc: "A nation may only operate under the consent of its ruling factions. Franconia remains divided among such estates, with contests and squabbling dominating the political atmosphere. We should clearly define the rights and privileges of each estate so that we might achieve unity through internal peace. Such a task, however, requires careful consideration to each group's needs."
 FKN_bauernkrieg_title: "Bauernkrieg"
 FKN_bauernkrieg_desc: "The peasantry from across the Great Empire grows restless. Sparked by obscene taxation and levies, the Great Peasant War runs rampant, with countless serfs rising above their labor, only to be slaughtered at the hands of German nobles. We must see to a swift end to the suffering within our own borders."
 FKN_kleinstaaterei_title: "Consolidate Kleinstaaterei"
 FKN_kleinstaaterei_desc: "The Empire is, and has always been, a fragmented and decentralized muddle of dynastic and territorial squabbling. Whilst we have no stake in foreign affairs, internal struggles are our own to bear. As such, we must see to the wholehearted unification of Franconia from within."
 FKN_ritterschaften_title: "Curb the Ritterschaften"
 FKN_ritterschaften_desc: "Although vital to any functioning state, the aristocratic class of Franconia grows ambitious with time. Their influence reaches far, perhaps farther than our own [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Such a situation cannot subsist. Through careful politicking may we halt the coming storm of nightmarish bureaucracy."
 FKN_trade_center_title: "Franconian Trade Center"
 FKN_trade_center_desc: "Franconia has always played a large part in the Rhenish Trade Network, however in recent years we have found our mercantile performance to be lacking. We require a stronger grip on the region's trade, which will only come from careful investment in infrastructure by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Not only Germans, but all of Europe will envy our grand monopolies."
 FKN_heritage_of_kilian_title: "St. Kilian's Patronage"
 FKN_heritage_of_kilian_desc: "Our devotion to the Lord and His emissaries knows no bounds. Saint Kilian, the Apostle of Franconia, was a model Christian, daring and stalwart in his faith. We would do well to follow suit and expand our earthly devotion."
 FKN_developing_land_title: "Developing Franconia"
 FKN_developing_land_desc: "These lands, scorched and blugeoned by war and famine, shall give rise to the new regional power of Germany. Before this ascension may occur, however, we must first see to the economic revitalization of Franconia, both physically and spiritually."
 FKN_capital_title: "Franconian Capital"
 FKN_capital_desc: "[Root.Capital.GetName] serves well as our seat of government, however we could do better. The recent economic boom Franconia has experienced shall give way to a glorious city at the center of Europe."
 FKN_universities_title: "Heart of Germany"
 FKN_universities_desc: "We are the beating heart of Germany, both geographically and intellectually. Franconian technology rises above our neighbors' in practicality, but we shan't rest on our laurels. Sponsoring the next generation of Germany's best and brightest shall bring us to the forefront of innovation."
 FKN_workshops_title: "Establish Workshops"
 FKN_workshops_desc: "Perhaps the most backwards system still embraced, feudalism is inherently wasteful of talent. Due to the particularly high dexterity of our workforce, it would be silly to subject the skilled serfs to servitude on the farms. We should open industrial opportunities so that our economy might prosper."
 FKN_franconian_beverages_title: "Franconian Beverages"
 FKN_franconian_beverages_desc: "Beer, wine, and everything in between. Franconia is known far and wide for the quality of our brew, and we should not let this opportunity go to waste. Our alochol industry is booming, it would behoove us to invest."
 FKN_franconian_dominance_title: "Imperial Dominance"
 FKN_franconian_dominance_desc: "Truly the heart and soul of Germany, Franconia plays a large part in the Empire. But it could be larger. We shan't rest until our glorious nation is known far and wide for its rightful virtue and prestige in German politics. We shall establish ourselves as the foremost power in Germany!"
 FKN_manufactories_title: "Export Focus"
 FKN_manufactories_desc: "Largely relying on our neighbors for manufactured goods, we put a fair bit of needless strain on our backwards economy. The preferred flow of goods should be outwards, as dictated by the policies of mercantilism. To this end, we must ramp up production at home."
 FKN_hre_capital_title: "Imperial Capital"
 FKN_hre_capital_desc: "Seated at the center of the Empire, Nürnberg is perhaps the cultural and economic center of both Germany and the Franconian people. The Empire has known no true capital since the days of Otto; Nürnberg shall fill that void in all but formality."
 FKN_abase_loyalists_title: "Abase Loyalists"
 FKN_abase_loyalists_desc: "We must strike out while our bid for the Imperial Throne lays hidden from the public eye. It would do us well to deter the loyalist scum of the Electorship from interrupting us from our grand plans."
 FKN_support_title: "Attain Support"
 FKN_support_desc: "No emperor may stand strong without help from his supporters. In order to obtain the Emperorship through diplomatic means, we must first secure a decently-sized voter base to ensure the election proceeds in our favor."
 FKN_emperorship_title: "A Feather in Our Cap"
 FKN_emperorship_desc: "What a nice crown, what's next?"
 FKN_absolute_loyalty_title: "Absolute Loyalty"
 FKN_absolute_loyalty_desc: "For the Empire to stand strong, we cannot remain so divided. No matter how small, the threat of losing the Emperorship to some upstart will always remain. We must take the proper steps to ensure our empire remains whole and our popular support remains strong among the Electors."
 FKN_franconia_ascendant_title: "Franken Ascendant"
 FKN_franconia_ascendant_desc: "The glory of Franconia knows no bounds, nor does our propensity for honor and splendor. We represent the key shift in the political landscape that will bring the Holy Roman Empire to the forefront of world affairs. The Habsburg stranglehold over Germany has ended, and our reign will be eternal!"
 FKN_powerbase_title: "Acquire Powerbase"
 FKN_powerbase_desc: "No longer able to rely on the Habsburg army to defend the Empire, we must muster our courage and stand as both the bulwark of Germany and Christianity. We shall begin the levying of a grand army in defense of the fatherland and its bountiful lands."
 FKN_imperial_ban_title: "Restore the Borders"
 FKN_imperial_ban_desc: "The slow decline of the Empire has not gone unnoticed by the [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s careful eyes. The Habsburgs let the fatherland crumble beneath their boots; it is now our job to restore its glory, one province at a time. The Holy Roman Empire will know unity, one way or another."
 FKN_in_defense_title: "In Defensionem"
 FKN_in_defense_desc: "The main point of an army is not to do war, but to assure your enemies that they would be crushed, should they offer resistance. In its current state, our armed forces may stand grand, but we must amass such a force that even the might of the world could not stand in our way."
 FKN_imperial_enemies_title: "Imperial Enemies"
 FKN_imperial_enemies_desc: "Even now, there are those within the Emprire that seek our removal from power. Unfortunately for them, strength of arms shall prove triumphant over politics. Our tremendous military power shall leave them trampled beneath our hooves as we sack their cities, proving Franconian dominance and unity to all that seek to oppose our might."
 FKN_grace_title: "Grace Entire Nations"
 FKN_grace_desc: "The seat of Emperor's strength goes beyond that of a mere nation within the Empire. None know true sovereingty under us, and we shall prove that. The power of the throne shall show our allies grace, just as it wreaks havoc among our enemies."
 FKN_reform_the_empire_title: "Reform the Empire"
 FKN_reform_the_empire_desc: "The state of the Empire, though not stagnant, has evolved far too slowly for our tastes. The disunified states must be brought together for the most important cause of all: servitude to the Emperor. The strength of the throne shall unite the scattered duchies, bishoprics, and republics of the Empire into one true nation."
 FKN_religious_peace_title: "Institute Religious Peace"
 FKN_religious_peace_desc: "Whilst the Pope maintains dominion over his Catholics, he holds no authority over our Empire. Religion is simply another part of administration, to which we hold sole authority over in our lands. The rule of law and the rule of God are closer than one might think."
 FKN_ensure_loyalty_title: "Imperial Cities"
 FKN_ensure_loyalty_desc: "The two integral cities of the Empire, Frankfurt and Aachen, provide legitimacy to each Emperor upon their ascension to the office. It is important that we ensure they support our righteous reign over the Empire and its people, lest questions arise of our rule."
