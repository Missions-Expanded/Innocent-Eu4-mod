The administration of the isles has been frought with challenge, and so we have adopted the parliamentary system to rule the domain.

 brl_ideas_2: "Pagan Traditions"

 brl_ideas_6: "Combined Arms"
 brl_ideas_6_desc: "The Celtic people are a varied mass from all walks of life. Warriors, especially find themselves experts in all manner of combat. Learning from everyones' specialties and integrating them into our armies will only create a more effective fighting force."
