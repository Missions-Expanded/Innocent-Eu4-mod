 bur_nevers_ME_title:0 "Integrate Nevers"
 bur_nevers_ME_desc:0 "Rumour has it that our puppet on the throne of Nevers is a practitioner of black magics. It wouldn't do to associate with such heresy; Nevers is better off brought into the fold."
 bur_lorraine_ME_title:0 "A Kingdom Divided"
 bur_lorraine_ME_desc:0 "Our holdings in the North and South are extensive, yet the division of our birthright is difficult at best. The Duchies of Lorraine and Barrois are the missing link, and clearly belong under our ownership."
 bur_liege_ME_title:0 "Control Liege"
 bur_liege_ME_desc:0 "Historically, the Bishopric of Liège has been a strong voice in the Vatican, and in the Holy Roman Empire. By extension, if we were to control this voice, we could better represent our interests."
 bur_subjects_ME_title:0 "Placate Subjects"
 bur_subjects_ME_desc:0 "As the leader of so many fragile unions, we cannot be seen to have any disloyal subjects. While we consider our claims on Lotharingia, we must ensure that all our partners are bolstered and ready to act."
 bur_subjects.tooltip:1 "All subjects have less than §Y1.00%§! Liberty Desire"
 bur_romandie_ME_title:0 "Reclaim Transjurania"

 bur_cisjurania_ME_title:0 "Kingdom of the Arles"
 bur_cisjurania_ME_desc:0 "The Duchy of Lower Burgundy, once ruled by Richard Justiciarius, who united all of Burgundy under his reign, should be returned to us. The Arelat must be restored!"
 bur_frisia_ME_title:0 "Frisian Conquest"
 bur_frisia_ME_desc:0 "The rest of the Low Countries region is in thrall to us. Only Frisia remains outside our control - we shall have it for ourselves."
 BUR_ned_ambitions_title: "Netherlands Ambitions"
 BUR_ned_ambitions_desc: "The conquest of Frisia has made apparent how lucrative controlling the Low Countries could really be. To fully exploit the riches of the Dutch, it is imperative to conquer the heartland of the Low Countries itself."
 BUR_holland_title: "Integrate Holland"
 BUR_holland_desc: "The Duchy of Holland has been a title under the Dukes of Burgundy for long enough. Integrating them directly into our should allow us to reach trading oppurtunities we could not fully consider before."
 BUR_flanders_title: "Integrate Flanders"
 BUR_flanders_desc: "The integration of the County of Flanders has been ignored for too long. Finally controlling the flemish coast should spur the drive to the sea!"

 BUR_challenge_eng_title: "Challenge England"
 BUR_challenge_eng_desc: "With a strong grasp over Low Countries, it is time to start looking towards the wide expanses of the ocean. One major obstacle remains, however and it is the domination by the English. If we are to project any further than our shores, we must challenge the hegemony of the English."
 BUR_eng_1_title: "Gain a Foothold on the Britain"

 BUR_eng_2_title: "Sack London"
 BUR_eng_2_desc: "The conquest of London will mark a historic turning point for the [Root.GovernmentName] of Burgundy.  The British Isles, once again successfully invaded, will eventually succumb to our rule."
 BUR_eng_3_title: "Secondary Foothold"
 BUR_eng_3_desc: "Redundancy is key. Should the English successfully mount a successful counterattack and reclaim Kent, it would serve us well to have secondary forward base."
 BUR_eng_4_title: "Control Southern Coast"
 BUR_eng_4_desc: "Following the conquest of London, the region of Wessex remains as the vanguard against mainland invaders."
 BUR_eng_5_title: "Conquer West Midlands"
 BUR_eng_5_desc: "Having conquered the southern coast of Britain, the interior Midlands are now next on the itinerary."
 BUR_eng_6_title: "Conquer Wales"
 BUR_eng_6_desc: "The Welsh hinterland lies to the west of the Midlands; despite being a proudly distinct nation separate from the English, their ties with the English Monarchy are too strong to ignore, lest the fleeing monarchy of the English attempt to reestablish there."
 BUR_eng_7_title: "Conquer the Eastern Coast"
 BUR_eng_7_desc: "Pushing up the eastern coastline and claiming strategic points will establish our dominance within the North Sea. Conquering the interior will further the dismantling of England."

 BUR_eng_10_title: "Eliminate England"
 BUR_eng_10_desc: "With the whole of England Proper conquered, all that remains is to abolish their monarchy to dissuade any upstart prodigal sons from attempting to restart the Kingdom. Finally eliminating England will not only secure the future stability of this domain, but will also open up colonisation opportunities."
 BUR_italy_ambitions_title: "Italian Ambitions"
 BUR_italy_ambitions_desc: "The Kingdom of Arles has given us an ample border with the Italian peninsula. With the Italians divided, it may be in our best intrest to capitalize on their weakness."
 BUR_challenge_fra_title: "Challenge France"
 BUR_challenge_fra_desc: "Finally reclaiming the titles and territories of times long past have proven us to be a formidable power within Europe. However, being one of the best is not enough to secure our domain for the centuries to come."
 BUR_challenge_hre_title: "Challenge the Emperor"
 BUR_challenge_hre_desc: "The Dukes of Burgundy have long been at odds with it's neighbors even since the days of Middle Francia. The truth of the matter is that the location of Burgundy is not one that inspires friendship; one of these Rivals has been the Holy Roman Emperor, who has long attempted to impose their rule over us."
 BUR_swiss_title: "Conquer Switzerland"
 BUR_swiss_desc: "The Swiss Confederacy is a thorn in our side. Though they join us in rejecting the Empire and are practically independent, the Confederacy shows little intrest in acting alongside us."

 BUR_fra_1_title: "Conquer Île-de-France"
 BUR_fra_1_desc: "Île-de-France stands as the heart of France. If we are to assert ourselves as the major power - above France and Empire - we must strike decisively at the Heart."
 BUR_fra_2_title: "Sack Paris"
 BUR_fra_2_desc: "Conquering and the political and cultural center of France would prove to be massive boon towards our conquests. Reducing Paris to a backwater would relegate major political activity - not only in France - but all of Europe to our own capital."
 BUR_fra_3_title: "Conquer the Parisian Surroundings"
 BUR_fra_3_desc: "The rich farmlands which surround Paris feed the great city. The food and goods produced in these satellite provinces will make an excellent addition to our own granaries and coffers."
 BUR_fra_4_title: "Conquer Loire"
 BUR_fra_4_desc: "West of Île-de-France lies the region of Loire, which follows the northern portion of the Loire River. If we continue along this path, it will make transort of troops to the western fringes in our campaign much easier."
 BUR_fra_5_title: "Conquer Massif Central"
 BUR_fra_5_desc: "To the south of Île-de-France lies Massif Central, which hosts the mouth and southern portion of the Loire River. The terrain of the region proves to be quite an obstacle, but eliminating it from the checklist will be the last major obstacle in our path."
 BUR_fra_6_title: "The Indomitable"
 BUR_fra_6_desc: "The Bretons remain on the outskirts of the French domain. Though they attempt to resist French hegemony, it would be ideal for us to unite the region regardless. \n\n'The enemy of my enemy is also my enemy if they hold land we need.' ~[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 BUR_fra_7_title: "Consolidate Eastern France"

 BUR_fra_11_desc: "The final capitulation of France will mark the beginning of a new age for Europe."
 BUR_norman_area_title: "Conquer Normandy"
 BUR_norman_area_desc: "The opening of the markets of Champagne have reignited the intrest of our merchants to expand into the English channel. Normandy would make an excellent location to further such pursuits."
 BUR_thicc_capital_title: "Center of the World"
 BUR_thicc_capital_desc: "The reduction of Paris and England to backwater counties have afforded us an opportunity to make our own capital a shining beacon of civilization.
