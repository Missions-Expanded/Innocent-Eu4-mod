 #South Indian Missions#
 south_ind_malabar_area_title: "Unite the Cheras!"
 south_ind_malabar_area_desc: "The coastal cities in Kerala were once home to the Chera Dynasty from long ago. They held some sway inland in the Kongu area, but they were mostly known for their lucrative trade along the coasts of Kerala and for being intermittent subjects of the Pandya Dynasty and the Chola Dynasty. Being of Tamilakam ourselves, we will need these coastal cities to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the people of the region."
 south_ind_jungle_development_title: "Jungle Developments"
 south_ind_jungle_development_desc: "It is not easy to cut through dense jungle that is home to a variety of wild animals and plants along. To go along with this, harsh terrain makes the job even harder and has historically made only the coasts habitable; inland settlements are rare and smaller in comparison. If we concentrate some effort on working the land, however, we can begin to make some progress toward expanding inward from the coast and toward those scattered settlements of villages. Trade, taxation, and military affairs will also benefit from the increased flexibility in travel areas."
 south_ind_madura_area_title: "Unite the Pandyas!"
 south_ind_madura_area_desc: "Madurai has been the heart of the Pandya Dynasty back when it was a grand power in the 600s to 800s and again in the 1100s to 1300s. Ever since the Muslims from the far north raided the Pandya Dynasty during a time of political crisis in the mid-1300s, their power has withered away into near nothingness. There must be a worthy state that can hold Madurai firmly against future incursions and whether or not it be a branch of the Pandya Dynasty that does this, it will return to its former glory in time."
 south_ind_build_temples_title: "Offerings to the Gods"
 south_ind_build_temples_desc: "There are many great temples in the lands of Southern India, but how do they become as great and beautiful as they are? It is through royal patronage that they become like this and we should strive to continue this legacy. The many temples and their religious followers will help garner taxes and internal unity within our state if we are able to help keep them afloat financially."
 south_ind_tanjore_area_title: "Unite the Cholas!"
 south_ind_tanjore_area_desc: "The great Chola Dynasty of the past came from the likes of the Tanjore area. They were the ones who made the world tremble at the sight of their boats and soldiers! They carved out a mighty empire the likes of which few in Southern India could ever dream of from the mid-800s to the late 1200s, ultimately being defeated by the rising power of the Pandya Dynasty and the Hoysala Empire. Taking Tanjore into our fold will help bring the whole of Tamilakam under our grasp and ensure that we have a viable area to launch naval invasions from, just as the Chola Dynasty did in ages past."
 south_ind_stable_tanjore_title: "Stability in Tanjore"
 south_ind_stable_tanjore_desc: "The Tanjore area is ripe for opportunity and development as the Chola Dynasty found out long ago. Such memories of potential in the land and the people is not lost on us, but we must start from somewhere in order to gain any sort of profit or foundation out of the area itself. Where then do we start at? It is in the form of increasing our hold over the communities so that they obey our administration."
 south_ind_stable_madura_title: "Prosperity of Madura"
 south_ind_stable_madura_desc: "Madura and its heart of Madurai is tough to rein in, but it is not impossible to do so. Garnering the good favor of local communities and integrating the people into our state over time will help stabilize the area and bring not only increased revenue to us, but also increased legitimacy."
 south_ind_stable_malabar_title: "Splendor of Kerala"
 south_ind_stable_malabar_desc: "Kerala may be lucrative but we must remember how tough the natural landscape is. Reaching out to the prosperous coastal communities and having them work in our favor instead of their own favor will help unite the entirety of the region and streamline revenue from the valuable trade cities that the Chera Dynasty once held as their own."
 south_ind_kongu_area_title: "Paths into Kongu"
 south_ind_kongu_area_desc: "The Kongu area is vital to us for a number of reasons. Those that live there are largely our Tamil brothers and sisters, but even without this cultural tie, the Kongu area is the overland entrance into the southern reaches of the Deccan. If we can secure this small but important area and lock it down firmly, our plans to the north will become all the more clear."
 south_ind_south_carnatic_area_title: "Carnatic Ambitions"
 south_ind_south_carnatic_area_desc: "The fertile flat lands along the coast just north of the Tanjore area are valued by a great many people for good reason. Trade occurs in plentiful amounts at the ports of Tondainadu and Cuddalore and along with this, fertile farmlands are available for a growing population. Thus, it is vital that we secure these two ports and the surrounding land before we get ahead of ourselves."
 south_ind_tamilakam_incarnate_title: "Homeland of the Tamils"
 south_ind_tamilakam_incarnate_desc: "Centuries upon centuries have gone by and we faced nothing but divisions and hardship. There were a few times of unification for our homeland, islands of safety and prosperity in our history that pulled away from the factionalism and petty conflicts that are recorded in our hearts and minds. Perhaps we can finally put a stop to this endless cycle of infighting and internal strife. We can learn from the Cheras, the Pandyas, and the Cholas of the past and cultivate something not seen since the Chola Empire of centuries before: a prosperous and stable Tamil empire."
 south_ind_fortify_the_frontier_title: "Garrisons and Walls"
 south_ind_fortify_the_frontier_desc: "The land of Tamilakam is quite defendable if one takes the time to build fortifications that mesh well with the harsh terrain. If we can muster the funds and materials to build fortifications that actually defend our land, the militaristic ones in our ranks will surely be pleased with us. On top of this, seeing mighty fortifications built by ones of brothers and sisters in culture will help draw people to military ranks in general, so there is little reason for us not to invest in this matter."
 south_ind_tamil_shipyards_title: "Markets and Ships"
 south_ind_tamil_shipyards_desc: "Attracting people versed in naval matters is something that we will need if ever hope to as successful on the water as our ancestors were. Sailors, admirals, and merchants that come to our vast markets will do us well when we begin to invest heavily in our navy since they can advise us on which ships to build, as well as help protect the most lucrative trade routes on the water that we use."
