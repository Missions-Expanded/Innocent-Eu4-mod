 spi_matter_balance_title: "A Matter of Balance"
 spi_matter_balance_desc: "Once I have been lost in what they told me to believe, until I felt it burning deep inside to set my spirit free, and I escaped to another world to help the little men, who make me plunge into philosophy - to feel my mind again... No one left to hold me tight on the real other side but her in chains."
 spi_education_universities_title: "Education and Universities"
 spi_education_universities_desc: "However, the attempt by the Iberian authorities to adapt the island's situation to the changing times is undeniable. The need to train officials and employees in the royal administration was met for a certain period with academic emigration to Spain and Italy (Salamanca, Bologna and Pisa were the most sought after destinations). Finally, in the twenties of the century, the two universities of Sassari and Cagliari were legally redefined. For some decades the Jesuit colleges had been operating on the island, which already served as centers of study and training for Sardinian intellectuality. Their reform and restructuring gave birth to the two universities. Their level remained good for many decades, until the end of the century, when the general crisis of the Iberian institutions also overwhelmed the Sardinian ones."
 spi_imperial_powerness_title: "Imperial Powerness"
 spi_imperial_powerness_desc: "The first time the Frankish army and the Imperial knights ravaged the basin of the Po bringing devastation, diseases and death into the prosperous lands of Northern Italy a common feeling of revenge grew ever stronger in the heart of the Italians, we have razed their capitals, slaughtered their men and made them pay by death as forfeit."
 spi_barbarians_italy_title: "Barbarians Out of Italy!"
 spi_barbarians_italy_desc: "You have been oppressed enough; you have suffered under an iron game! Our armies have come to Italy for your release! A new order of things is about to arise that restored public happiness to you. Begin to enjoy the fruits of your liberation, following the beneficial measures already applied wherever our liberating weapons have reached. Where we are not yet, it is up to you frank and courageous Italians to work with weapons in hand the restoration of your prosperity and of your homeland. You will do it all the better, as you will be helped to chase away anyone who opposes this result. You have to become an independent nation. Show your zeal for the public good and your happiness will depend on your faithfulness to those who love and defend you. In a short time your fate will be the object of envy, your new state will arouse admiration."

 spi_artistical_resurgence_title: "Artistical Resurgence"
 spi_artistical_resurgence_desc: "Over time, a local aristocratic class was created in Sardinia, albeit largely of Catalan origin, as well as a class of Sardinian intellectuals and officials, engaged in the administration of the kingdom or in the feudal one. The cities (Cagliari, the capital, and again: Iglesias, Oristano, Bosa, Alghero, Sassari and Castellaragonese), subtracted from the feudal regime, enjoyed wide privileges (customs, commercial, jurisdictional), depended directly on the royal administration (for this they called themselves “royal cities”) and sent their own representatives to the Cortes (parliament). In 1543 the equalization before the law of the Sardinians was formalized with the subjects of Iberian origin of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Event that sanctioned the abandonment by the Sardinians of any desire for revenge and the widespread resignation to Iberian domination. Some Sardinian intellectuals will try, over the course of the century, to emancipate the culture of the island from the condition of inferiority to which it had been relegated. Emblematic figures of this renewal were Nicolò Canelles or Canyelles, first episcopal vicar of Cagliari and then Bishop of Bosa, who founded the first printing house in Sardinia in 1566. \nThe cultural awakening, however, was partly stifled by the action of the Spanish Inquisition, under whose jurisdiction Sardinia was subject, to impose a control of Sardinian cultural life, both among the ruling class and at the popular level."
 spi_northern_meddling_title: "The Northern Meddling"
 spi_northern_meddling_desc: "One by one they have fallen, one by one they have kneeled down to the might of our Kingdoms, one by one their rulers have been humiliated along the main roads of our capitals showing what their might seemed to us: nothing."
 spi_lombardo_veneto_title: "Lombardo Veneto"
 spi_lombardo_veneto_desc: "The northern lands of the Italian Peninsula have been plagued by influence from the Holy Roman Empire to the north and the Papal States to the south. The various republics and duchies that are seeking to find a path through the harrowing times need strong and righteous leadership that stems from inside the Italian Peninsula, not outside of it. The various people of the north though... They do not seem to be capable of carving out a state strong enough to claim this position; it seems to only be the Lombards and Venetians who are able to. If they can set aside their differences and come together somehow, perhaps a brighter and more unified future is possible."

 #3rd column
 spi_mountain_islands_title: "Mountain and Islands"
 spi_mountain_islands_desc: "Northern Italy is made up, there are no longer Lombards, Piedmontese, Tuscans, or Romagnoli, we are all Italians; but there are still the Neapolitans. Oh! there is a lot of corruption in their country. It is not their fault, poor people: they have been so poorly governed! And that rascal Ferdinando! No, no, such a corrupt government can no longer be restored: Providence will not allow it. We must moralize the country, educate children and youth, create asylum rooms, military colleges: but don't think of changing the Neapolitans by insulting them. They ask me for jobs, crosses, promotions. They must work, they must be honest, and I will give them crosses, promotions, decorations; but above all do not let one pass him: the employee must not even be suspected. No state of siege, no means of absolute government. Everyone is capable of governing with the state of siege. I will rule them with freedom, and show what ten years of freedom can do with that beautiful country. In twenty years they will be the richest provinces in Italy. No, no state of siege: I recommend it."
 spi_regia_armata_sarda_title: "Regia Armata Sarda"
 spi_regia_armata_sarda_desc: "The soldiers of the Sardinian army had a social background composed of 65% of peasants, 25% were workers and artisans, while bourgeois and aristocrats made up in all only 10% of the staff in service. From a cultural point of view, 20% were illiterate, while only 5% had a higher education. The regiments had schools for soldiers where they taught reading, writing and arithmetic. \nThe infantrymen were essentially armed with bayonet rifles and with a dagger held to the body by a leather belt to be worn together with the rifle bandolier. The officers had no firearms, but only had the white weapon."
 spi_fall_dukedom_title: "Fall of the Dukedom"
 spi_fall_dukedom_desc: "Il Granducato di Toscana? What is so great about a state that has asked for forgiveness when our armies marched down their lands and brought wrath into their ruins?"

 spi_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 spi_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 #4th column
 spi_port_modernization_title: "Port's Modernization"
 spi_port_modernization_desc: "The only outlet to the sea with difficulty maintained and defended, Nice had two particular values which, despite its eccentric position, made it an essential cornerstone of the Savoy dominions: it constituted a strong border with France, as well as a place of cautious neighborhood with the Spaniards who controlled the marquisate of Finale; it guaranteed the Piedmontese princes, thanks to the port of Villafranca, the possibility of commercial and diplomatic exchanges by sea."
 spi_fall_thousand_sigil_title: "Fall of the Thousand Sigil"
 spi_fall_thousand_sigil_desc: "This young autocrat has obeyed throughout his life, first to his father and stepmother, who educated him in an impenetrable retreat, both a barracks and a convent. Then, from his event, to the camarilla, which kept him in the immobility of the last kingdom. Later, to the double-faced Machiavellianism of General Filangieri, the man who most disregarded and pushed back this already vacillating monarchy. And then, as an addition to that camarilla, who placed the police in his hands, and placed Aiossa, Maniscalco, the two fatal men who brought, one to Naples, and the other to Palermo, the last blows of ax to the abandoned throne of the Bourbons."

 #5th column
 spi_industrialisation_attempts_title: "Tentatìvu Industriàre"
 spi_industrialisation_attempts_desc: "For a long time both the feudal regime and the local customs remained completely unchanged. Sardinia was still divided into fiefs, of heterogeneous extension and jurisdiction. The owner of the fiefdom was often absent, preferably residing in the cities or outside the island. Instead of the baron, one of his officials, known as podatariu, was responsible for the collection of taxes and duties. These were numerous and often very heavy for the vassals, the inhabitants of the fiefdom. In many cases, their collection was contracted out to the so-called “surrenders”, private debt collectors who paid a fixed and previously agreed fee to the administration of the fiefdom and profited from the surplus of taxes. The imposition was therefore aggravated by this practice, with consequent protests and rebellions, in the years of famine. Then there was the problem of jurisdiction, since criminal and civil cases, at least in the first instance, were the responsibility of the lord. Taxation and the administration of justice therefore remained firmly in the hands of the aristocratic class."
 spi_mining_investments_title: "Mining Investments"
 spi_mining_investments_desc: "Following the treaty of The Hague, the island became part of the possessions of the Dukes of Savoy, who acquired the title of King of Sardinia. The Savoy state gave new impetus to mining. Even under the Piedmontese, the exercise of mining was linked to the assignment of general concessions for carrying out research and the cultivation of mines throughout the island. The first to obtain this type of concession, lasting twenty years, were Pietro Nieddu and Stefano Durante from Cagliari. The royalties had to be paid upon shipment for the exported materials, and every six months for those sold on the island. \nThe new company, mainly under the impulse of Mandel, introduced several technological innovations, including the use of explosives during the extraction works. Skilled workers in the mining art, especially Germans, were brought to Sardinia. The construction of a large lead foundry near Villacidro is due to Mandel. However, he was accused by the Royal Intendency of neglecting the exploration of new mines, limiting himself to the exploitation of existing ones. An investigation was also opened for alleged tax irregularities, which led, in 1758, to the revocation of the concession to Mandel."
 spi_conquest_sicily_title: "Conquest of Sicily"
 spi_conquest_sicily_desc: "The only force opposed to the Bourbons that showed the will to take up arms was Sicilian independence: starting from October of that year outbreaks of protest had been registered on the island and Salvatore Maniscalco, general director of the police on the island, had escaped an assassination attempt. The memories of the long revolution that had led to the months of the constitutional kingdom of Sicily were still vivid, the Bourbon repression had been particularly harsh and the attempts of the Neapolitan government to reach a political settlement were null and void. Furthermore, intolerance was not limited to the ruling classes, but involved, albeit with different motives and objectives, a large segment of the urban and rural population."

 ME_Sardinia_Piedmont_Events.1.T: "One House"
 ME_Sardinia_Piedmont_Events.1.D: "The perfect fusion refers to the political and administrative union between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the mainland states owned by the Savoy, including Piedmont, the Duchy of Savoy, Nice, the former imperial fiefs of the Ligurian Apennines (which included the Novese and dell'Ovadese) and the former Republic of Genoa with the island of Capraia, similar to what the English crown had done almost fifty years earlier. But a problem now falls, given the growth of tensions between some nationalists, both Piedmontese and Sardinians."

 ME_Sardinia_Piedmont_Events.2.D: "A new mining law was instituted, which provided for the separation of ownership of the soil from that of the subsoil. According to the new law, anyone could request authorization to carry out mining research; the written authorization of the owner of the fund on which the research was to be carried out was required but, if the owner of the fund opposed the research and the refusal was not considered adequately argued, the Prefect could proceed to grant the authorization ex officio. The concessionaire's only obligation was to pay 3 percent of the value of the minerals extracted to the treasury and to compensate the owners of the funds for the damage caused. This discipline came fully into force in Sardinia only after the perfect fusion between Sardinia and the mainland states belonging to the Savoy had been achieved."

 ME_Sardinia_Piedmont_Events.4.D: "The ducal architect Amedeo di Castellamonte, based on a project by the late Duke Carlo Emanuele II and encouraged by the regent Madama Reale Maria Giovanna Battista of Savoy-Nemours, mother of the little Vittorio Amedeo II, began the construction of a building intended to house a knightly academy , center of studies and training for the nobility of all Europe, on the model of the Ritterakademien of other European countries. It was accessed with sovereign approval only: 200 was the number of students expected. Of these, 75 were paid by the Government; then there were 16 "Pages of Honor", with pension paid by the Royal House. The Military Academy therefore carried within itself the tradition of the ancient Court Paggeria. Admission was between 9 and 12 years of age and the duration of the course was 8 years to obtain the rank of second lieutenant in the Infantry or Cavalry; The course of study for the students of the Artillery and Engineers was nine years, from which they came out with the rank of Lieutenant."
