 NUM_city_above_all_title: "Deutsche Hauptstadt"
 NUM_city_above_all_desc: "Since the Golden Bull of 1356, our city of Nuremberg has received many rights and has prospered more and more ever since. But Nuremberg is not the only city in its golden age. Bohemian Prague and Austrian Vienna have become pretenders to the title of the Imperial City. We must strive towards once again becoming the dominant city either by making Nuremberg flourish or by destroying its opponents."
 NUM_stadtbiblothek_title: "Establish the Stadtbibliothek"
 NUM_stadtbiblothek_desc: "In spite of the invention of Printing Press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439, books aren't yet widespread enough to be considered affordable for all Imperial citizens and are still considered luxurious by the majority of the population. To make literature more accessible and promote reading, our city should invest in a Library to fulfill the literary needs of the townspeople."
 NUM_german_renaissance_title: "Deutsche Renaissance"
 NUM_german_renaissance_desc: "The Prosperity of Nuremberg is attracting many great men to the city. As such, many humanists of the "Rebirth" era have gathered up in the city and started a community of brilliant minds. There's no other city like ours to be home to so many amazing people."

 NUM_expand_the_city_desc: "Naturally, as one of the major German Cities, immigrants flow into our town. Because of that, we need to expand the boundaries of the Stadt, allowing it to host many more people and thus prosper. If we don't do that, people will feel turned away."
 NUM_heydey_title: "The Heyday"
 NUM_heydey_desc: "The 15th century turned out to be the best one yet. We cannot let this trend end, therefore we must strive towards the prosperity of the city. To ensure the prosperity of the state, we must make sure the lands are stable and under leadership of an ambitious ruler."
