 lvn_unification_northern_italy_desc: "The constitution of an union of the proudest people in northern Italy was but a start of the creation of a superpower in Northern Italy able to rival the houses of the Dolphins and the Imperial Eagles. March forth my brave brothers, il Moscato Piemontese ed il Pesto Genovese will be in our hands when we will dine in the vast plains of the Emilia tomorrow."
 lvn_humiliation_rivals_title: "Humiliation of Rivals"
 lvn_humiliation_rivals_desc: "The first time the Frankish army and the Imperial knights ravaged the basin of the Po bringing devastation, diseases and death into the prosperous lands of Northern Italy a common feeling of revenge grew ever stronger in the heart of the Italians, we have razed their capitals, slaughtered their men and made them pay by death as forfeit."

 #2nd column
 lvn_esercito_lombardo_veneto_title: "Lombardo Veneto"
 lvn_esercito_lombardo_veneto_desc: "At the beginning of the reign the Lombard-Venetian military instrument was remarkable for the Italian mediums (forces the third army in size in Italy), but not suitable for European challenges, in particular the field artillery, the genius and the cavalry were undersized . The infantry regiments were then extremely small, certainly manageable (useful gift in mountainous environments or in the amphibious war), but impractical for the clashes in the plains, especially against the gigantic regiments of the other European powers (2,200-2,800 men at full staff) \nThe officer corps was well prepared on a theoretical level, even if promotions were generally granted only for seniority; and in fact the commanding officers and superiors were on average very old, with a few colonels without white or at least graying hair and numerous inferior officers who aged without any possibility of a grade advance. In addition, the bulk of the officer corps was occupied by mainland nobles or small Slavic "aristocrats" (more "de facto nobility" than by right), as well as several foreigners (Swiss, German), despite the opening of several pedagogical initiatives training of officers remained closed in exclusive circles. \nThis caste limitation also translated into a limitation to the recruitment and enhancement of talent and merit. Behind a facade of strength there were therefore many weaknesses."
 lvn_defense_northern_italy_title: "Defense of Northern Italy"
 lvn_defense_northern_italy_desc: "You have been oppressed enough; you have suffered under an iron game! Our armies have come to Italy for your release! A new order of things is about to arise that restored public happiness to you. Begin to enjoy the fruits of your liberation, following the beneficial measures already applied wherever our liberating weapons have reached. Where we are not yet, it is up to you frank and courageous Italians to work with weapons in hand the restoration of your prosperity and of your homeland. You will do it all the better, as you will be helped to chase away anyone who opposes this result. You have to become an independent nation. Show your zeal for the public good and your happiness will depend on your faithfulness to those who love and defend you. In a short time your fate will be the object of envy, your new state will arouse admiration."

 lvn_united_crowns_title: "The United Crowns"
 lvn_united_crowns_desc: "The northern lands of the Italian Peninsula have been plagued by influence from the Holy Roman Empire to the north and the Papal States to the south. The various republics and duchies that are seeking to find a path through the harrowing times need strong and righteous leadership that stems from inside the Italian Peninsula, not outside of it. The various people of the north though... They do not seem to be capable of carving out a state strong enough to claim this position; it seems to only be the Lombards and Venetians who are able to. If they can set aside their differences and come together somehow, perhaps a brighter and more unified future is possible."
 lvn_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 lvn_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 lvn_real_marina_title: "Real Marina"
 lvn_real_marina_desc: "During the battle of Paro, led by Leonardo Mocenigo, the Venetian fleet captured three large Turkish ships that were transferred to Venice to carry out the restoration work, then going to constitute the first nucleus of the permanent Real Marina the following year, formed by "public ships". \nThe main supporter of a state warship was Lazzaro Mocenigo, but his premature death led to a considerable slowdown in the project. It should be noted that the large army was equipped, until the launch of the Fulminant Jupiter and the Warrior Constancy, of a ship classifiable as a "galleon", while after that date ships were launched which belonged to the more modern type of the "vessel". The galleons had already been tried many times by Venetian shipbuilding since the early 16th century, but had been judged rather badly in the 16th century, and not well received afterwards, they could navigate well preserved with galleys and galleys, but they had bad characteristics of sailing with the crosswind. Indeed, if loaded with heavy armament, they often capsized and sank rapidly."
 lvn_mediterranean_piracy_title: "Mediterranean Piracy"
 lvn_mediterranean_piracy_desc: "The current problem of Piracy in the Mediterranean Sea comes from both the berbers lying in the north western shores of Africa and the despiteful turks in the Aegean sea, our confront with them is inevitable right now."

The turreted crown is gold in color. \nThe institute is dedicated to General Pietro Teulié who, during his stay in the Ministry of War, put his hand to the project of a military orphanage, in the current location of the school. The origins of the Military School of Milan can be traced back to the work of General Pietro Teulié, who was appointed Minister of War within the government of the Lombardy-Venetia Kingdom. Although he held that position for a period of a few months, he did his best to provide adequate accommodation for war veterans, invalids and military orphans during that period. Five months after his resignation as Minister of War, in fact, the general had the satisfaction of seeing his requests accepted. On January 1 of the following year Luigi Tordorò, who succeeded him as minister, sent the commissioner of War Guizzardi to preside over a commission for "the organization of a company of Invalids and two of Veterans and for the choice of a club in the house of San Luca that is right at an orphanage of forty children of the most deserving of our warriors ".\n\nThe new united army of the [Root.GetName] must be reformed, but on which of our many traditions and encounters shall be base the core of our new army?"
