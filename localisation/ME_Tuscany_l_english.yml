 tus_law_reform_title: "Law Reforms"
 tus_law_reform_desc: "The bourgeoisie is the emerging and heterogeneous class that has always characterized the Tuscan city society. The merchant, professional, artisan and financial middle class was also on the way to becoming landowners. From the medieval period it continued to be divided according to the profession carried out. The ancient corporate structure continued to exist with the seven major arts (judges and notaries, merchants of Calimala, money changers and bankers, wool merchants, silk merchants, doctors and apothecaries), the five medium arts (butchers, blacksmiths, shoe makers, masters of stone and wood, galigai) and the nine minor arts (winemakers, bakers, oilers, chiavaioli, liners, carpenters, cuirassiers and armourers, vaiai and cuoiai, hoteliers).

 tus_land_reform_title: "Land Reform"
 tus_land_reform_desc: "The Lorraine reforms are intended to heal the disastrous situation inherited from the last Medici with a programmatic economic policy. By favoring free private initiative and the free development of production, the Lorraine governments pushed innovations in three main sectors: agriculture considered as the main economic activity of the country, trade and manufacturing, the construction of public works aimed at facilitating a more agile circulation of commerce and to give work to the subjects, thus improving their standard of living. To these Pietro Leopoldo joins you with the important civil, administrative, judicial and social reforms, thus bringing the Grand Duchy to reach the European vanguard in many sectors. A characteristic of the Tuscan rural economy is the institution of communal origins of sharecropping which involves the peasant population in the land production of the large owners. The farm, understood as an organized land fund (cultures, livestock, farmhouse, water supply, etc.) became an essential element of the peasant world of the time. It is believed that at the advent of Pietro Leopoldo there were about 48,000 Tuscan farms, although most of them did not ensure full subsistence to the colonists and their families. "

With the Lorraine the artistic activity is revived and a ruling class of Tuscan intellectuals is reconstituted which together with economic activity is the most conspicuous aspect of the state in the whole stagnant panorama of Italy. The university studies of "La Sapienza" of Pisa, famous for teaching law and of "Lo Studio" of Siena, are renewed and given back dignity, becoming the centers of the Tuscan and Italian enlightenment, while in Florence there is a note surgical school at Santa Maria Novella. From these centers of culture men such as Bernardo Tanucci, Leopoldo Andrea Guadagni, Claudio Fromond, Paolo Frisi, Antonio Cocchi, Leonardo Ximenes are formed."

The few schools live on subsidies from the state or some benefactor and are badly organized. \nThe subjects taught are divided into various courses (humanity, rhetoric, philosophy, geometry, grammar, moral theology, physics, Latin, Greek, etc.). From the mid-18th century, public schools for girls began to be organized to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, women's arts (sewing, embroidery, cooking, etc.), social duties, religion, Italian grammar, French, geography. , music, design, dance. But with the Leopoldine reforms many institutes were suppressed and the schools reorganized and aggregated together. \nCenter of European culture throughout the Renaissance, the Grand Duchy inherited and developed its enormous artistic and intellectual heritage even in the following centuries, albeit in a more modest and circumscribed form.

In this sense, the Accademia degli Umidi was the rival institution of the Accademia degli Infiammati from Padua. "
 tus_nove_conservatori_title: "Nove Conservatori"
 tus_nove_conservatori_desc: "The bad administration of the territory had generally rendered the already insufficient viability of Tuscany unusable, aggravated also by the phenomenon of banditry in the most remote areas of the state such as Val di Chiana and Maremma. Traced without planning, without regulations and maintenance, the Tuscan roads were in a state of semi-neglect, often resulting in simple paths barely visible to disappear into marshes or dust, interrupted by streams or fords without signs. Especially in the winter season they became largely impassable due to the rain."

 tus_monete_misure_desc: "The Tuscan monetary and measurement system was based on the very ancient duodecimal system of Etruscan-Roman origins. The currency par excellence was the Gold Florin, known and appreciated throughout Europe for its intrinsic golden value and the subject of numerous forgeries and imitations by other powers. Obviously, the exchange value of Tuscan coins changed over the centuries. At the time of the Italian unification, the basic currency of the grand duchy was the Tuscan or Florentine lira, equivalent to 84 cents of the Italian lira of the time. One Lira consisted of 20 Tuscan soldi. The mint was in Florence and Pisa. The units of measurement, referring to their medieval origins, in particular the agricultural ones, could vary from city to city, even if the Florentine ones became increasingly common."
 tus_armata_granducale_title: "Armata Granducale"
 tus_armata_granducale_desc: "After the long wars that led Florence to the annexation of much of today's Tuscany and with the last great war against Siena, the Medici and then Lorraine government maintained an army composed of a few units of mercenaries and veterans who often only carried out a internal control on the territory for the absolute absence of neighboring enemies, supporting the bargello and its brewers in the tasks of protecting public order.

 tus_trade_zone_livorno_desc: "The Livorno port was originally located on the edge of Porto Pisano, the complex port system that extended between the then Labbronian village and Pisa. With the slow decay of the Pisan Republic and the increasingly scarce maintenance of its port structures, the small inlet located near Livorno assumed greater importance. The first important expansion of the port of Labronica took place in the early fifteenth century, when the Genoese, having become masters of the castle of Livorno, built, in addition to the existing port (Pamiglione), a small internal dock, known as the Porticciolo dei Genovesi; a navigable canal connected the dock, located at the height of the current Piazza Grande, with the sea, corresponding to the original nucleus of the future Old Fortress. In 1421 Livorno passed under the dominion of the Republic of Florence and, a few years later, the port was equipped with an imposing tower (the Torre del Marzocco), in the place where there were numerous towers of the Pisan era, such as the Maltarchiata.

 tus_commercial_fleet_title: "Commercial Fleet"
 tus_commercial_fleet_desc: "Tuscany has never had a real commercial fleet of its own, nor its own crews.

Thornton himself confirmed these tales and stated that the country was rich in rosewood, wild sugar cane, white pepper, balsam, cotton and many other types of goods that could have constituted a great possibility of trade for the Tuscans.

 tus_colonial_supremacy_desc: "Beyond the natives and the scientific material brought to Italy, from a commercial point of view, Robert Thornton's ship was not very successful: he did not manage to sell or exchange Italian merchandise, returning to Livorno almost empty-handed, but at least he succeeded. to come back alive. In fact, he discovered and foiled a mutiny attempt organized by two gunners who wanted to kill him, steal the ship and resell the goods: the two traitors were abandoned on the Amazon delta, while the other conspirators were imprisoned in the ship's hold. Giles Thornton, who returned to Livorno in October of the following year, was instead more successful than his brother: he managed to sell all the Italian merchandise in Brazil, but chose not to shop due to commercial restrictions imposed by Spain."
