Cavalry was then the cutting edge of the military arm and a large cavalry ensured a great advantage in warfare. This placed a huge premium of the horse which were also required for the Emperor's personal use. The ownership of horses rather than elephants defined one's social status. Thus, they were much sought after in the Vijayanagara Empire. The Vijayanagara kings faced a huge problem when it came to acquiring horses as they did not breed well in the kingdom. Given the importance of the horse something had to be done to overcome this. The answer was to import the finest Arabian horses from the Arabian Peninsula. The importance of this trade is best illustrated by the fact that the Emperor paid for horses in gold! To consolidate his hold on the trade and to maintain a monopoly, he even paid for the horses that died while making the journey. This tactic effectively ensured a steady supply of horses and also reduced the supply of horses to their main rivals - the Bahamani Sultanate."
