 ### MISSIONS ###
 guj_chaulukya_style_title: "Chaulukya Style"
 guj_chaulukya_style_desc: "Maru-Gurjara architecture originated in the Chaulukya empire before, but their temples still stand and their style remains strong. The style is distinguished from other north Indian temples, in that external walls of the temples are structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. If we are to continue our friendly relationship with the local Jains, the temples must be preserved and the style conserved."
 guj_bab_al_makkah_title: "Bab al-Makkah"
 guj_bab_al_makkah_desc: "Surat, gateway to Mecca. Surat's importance has grown consistently over the past few centuries, as Khambat slowly silts and dries. It was one of the first places that willingly accepted Islam into its gates, and has remained a vibrant port for those who are making the Hajj. As Gujarat grows, and its cities slowly convert, Surat must be expanded to facilitate the transport of thousands yearly, and for Islam to continue it's way in India."

 ME_Gujarat_Events.1.t: "Founding the Banyan Company"
 ME_Gujarat_Events.1.d: "Jhaveri has been busy with his capital. Rather than hoard it for himself and only lend to the state when necessary, he appears to have created a group of like-minded individuals, who have been gathering at his Sarrafa's caravanserais. They have approached the state with the proposition of a chartered company, that will fly under the flag of Gujarat and sail across the indian ocean, setting up outposts. Through a complex web of ship transportation and currency exchanges, they will serve as bankers, brokers and traders. His associate, Virji Vora, already controls much of the pepper stock in Surat."
