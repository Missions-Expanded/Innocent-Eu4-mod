 ### MISSIONS ###
 guj_chaulukya_style_title: "Chaulukya Style"
 guj_chaulukya_style_desc: "Maru-Gurjara architecture originated in the Chaulukya empire before, but their temples still stand and their style remains strong. The style is distinguished from other north Indian temples, in that external walls of the temples are structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. If we are to continue our friendly relationship with the local Jains, the temples must be preserved and the style conserved."
 guj_bab_al_makkah_title: "Bab al-Makkah"
 guj_bab_al_makkah_desc: "Surat, gateway to Mecca. Surat's importance has grown consistently over the past few centuries, as Khambat slowly silts and dries. It was one of the first places that willingly accepted Islam into its gates, and has remained a vibrant port for those who are making the Hajj. As Gujarat grows, and its cities slowly convert, Surat must be expanded to facilitate the transport of thousands yearly, and for Islam to continue it's way in India."
 guj_pilgrim_burden_title: "Assume the Pilgrim Burden"
 guj_pilgrim_burden_desc: "Pilgrims from all over India make their way to Mecca, whether by land or, more easily, boat. Thousands flock to our shores, and since we lie at the closest point to Arabia, we have a duty to ensure the safe travels of these pilgrims. As our reach extends further into the ocean, it is easier to project our power and claim the seas as our own, thus we can protect the pilgrims on the high seas from the less friendly heathens."
 guj_facilitate_trade_title: "Mercantile Connections"
 guj_facilitate_trade_desc: "Khambay is uniquely situated to project power over all of the Indian ocean. Gujarati flags are seen is many ports, from the coffee plantations in Yemen, to the straights of Malacca and Kilwa Kisiwani. Khambay is home to many merchants and a flourishing Jain community that supports this. The ocean is only on Khambay's porch"
 guj_manufacture_title: "Gujarati Manufacture"
 guj_manufacture_desc: "The cities of Gujarat contain many guilds and artisans, each producing unique and intricate goods. Textiles dominate the coast in cities like Surat and Khambay, the latter of which contains a thriving banking caste of Jains. Ahmedabad produces the finest silk seen in any Indian city. These cities dominate trade and make Gujarat vibrant and appealing to the outside, which is why it is in our benefit to cultivate their riches."
 guj_textiles_title: "Queen of Handicrafts"
 guj_textiles_desc: "Gujarat is a land of captivating contrasts, bearing testimony to the richness and flamboyance of Gujarati handicraft culture. Patola silk sarees are woven in geometrical patterns and dyed in flaming colors. Folk motifs dominate the multicolored and delicate designs of Patola sarees with dazzling borders. High color durability is the mainstay of Patola silk sarees which are also available with zardosi embroidery and kundan work to be worn on festive occasions. The most spectacular textile based handicraft of Gujarat is needlework or embroidery. A pride of Gujaratis, embroidery is a woman-based handiwork that is known for elegance, delicacy and splendor the world over."
 guj_balance_of_trade_title: "Favourable Trade Balance"
 guj_balance_of_trade_desc: "[Root.GetName] has always had greater exports than imports, resulting in a favourable balance of trade. This is changing, however, due to the growth of manufacturing outside of India. As a result, we must ensure that our monopolistic attitude remains firm, and in reality"
 guj_transactions_between_theology_title: "Transactions between Theology"
 guj_transactions_between_theology_desc: "India is home to many religions, and the 2 most prominent when it comes to trade is Jainism and Islam. The words of Allah is already spread and accepted, albeit begrudgingly, by the Hindus. Jainism, however, is no longer dominant nor favoured by the masses, yet their bankers hold vast wealth and even special privileges in government. Religion should not get in the way of trade!"
 guj_rumi_elites_title: "Curtail the Rumi Elite"
 guj_rumi_elites_desc: "Unfortunately, the vast power held by the aristocracy has made royal power more and more obsolete. The turkic nobility squabbles and ruins the nation, making us easy prey to foreign outsiders or any turkish threat. We must prevent the nobles from dragging us down"
 guj_issue_land_title: "Issuing Land Grants"
 guj_issue_land_desc: "Land is distributed through 3 methods. Iqta land is given as a subsidiary instead of outright payment for officials, as thanks for their services. Khalisa land is the Sultan's own, and the revenue generated is used to fund the royal household. Finally, Inam land is for religious officials to appease the clergy. In order to prevent disaster once again, we must find a balance between patronage and preventing puppet status."
 guj_fiscal_matters_title: "Matters of Fiscal Nature"
 guj_fiscal_matters_desc: "A strong bureacracy is key to making an empire prosperous. Land needs structurng and ordering, especially when conquering. Gujarat is already split into parganas, divided between cities and historical land. Therefore, as the future of India looks well, we must prepare the government for a lengthy, and expensive, growth."
 guj_ahmedabad_paper_title: "Ahmadabad Paper"
 guj_ahmedabad_paper_desc: "Ahmed Shah had already taken the initiative of making Ahmedabad a prosperous city, groups of skilled artisans, merchants etc. were formed. Social institutions to safeguard various economic interests included the mahajans, guilds of merchants, and panches, guilds for artisans. The leader of the community, who came from the Jain business elites, was known as the nagarsheth, who would resolve disputes between mahajans and individuals and who interceded with royal officials. Under the nagarsheth, the city remained free from interference from the state or other powers."
 guj_alliance_with_caliph_title: "Alliance with the Caliph"
 guj_alliance_with_caliph_desc: "The Gujarati navy does not seem to be keeping up with times, and we have become increasingly subject to western ships and tactics destroying us in battle. We must connect with the current caliph and seek their assistance againsy the dastardly Europeans!"
 guj_deter_with_gold_title: "Deterrence with Gold"
 guj_deter_with_gold_desc: "What Gujarat lacks in arms, we make up for with money. A large and well paid army is enough to scare anyone into submission, but trade cannot sustain this. We need a suitable and reliable source of income, such as the Silver mine at Udaipur or the african reserves. Whatever we take, it will surely make Gujarat a powerhouse"

 ### EVENTS ###
 ME_Gujarat_Events.1.t: "Founding the Banyan Company"
 ME_Gujarat_Events.1.d: "Jhaveri has been busy with his capital. Rather than hoard it for himself and only lend to the state when necessary, he appears to have created a group of like-minded individuals, who have been gathering at his Sarrafa's caravanserais. They have approached the state with the proposition of a chartered company, that will fly under the flag of Gujarat and sail across the indian ocean, setting up outposts. Through a complex web of ship transportation and currency exchanges, they will serve as bankers, brokers and traders. His associate, Virji Vora, already controls much of the pepper stock in Surat."
 ME_Gujarat_Events.1.opt1: "Go ahead"
 ME_Gujarat_Events.1.opt2: "An ASSOCIATION? of INDEPENDENT merchants?! where will my TAXES come from?!!?!"

 ME_Gujarat_Events.2.t: "The Walls of Ahmedabad"
 ME_Gujarat_Events.2.d: "Our capital Ahmadabad has been growing rapidly ever since it was founded in 1411 and it seems unlikely this will ebb out any time soon. The close proximity of Khambat, one of the greatest ports in India and according to some the busiest port in the world ensures a constant stream of people, goods and capital. Such a rapidly growing city is, however, hard to defend effectively, especially given its position in the middle of the Gujarat plains. Some say we ought to take a more active part in the planning of the city and not only focus on how to adorn it."
 ME_Gujarat_Events.2.opt1: "Build the walls."
