 UKS_Integrate_French_Concessions_title: "Integrate the Concessions"
 UKS_Integrate_French_Concessions_desc: "We are the victor of this grand conflict, and thus the spoils are ours. The growth of unity between our peoples must be taken in strides, the first among which is the integration of such a prize. If we are foster such a relation with the French, we must see to these matters personally."
 UKS_recover_england_title: "The English Recovery"
 UKS_recover_england_desc: "While most of the conflict took place in the French Territories, so did England suffer much from the war. Many farm estates, filled with men who worked there, are now empty. The lack of men to work is hurting our economy greatly, hence we need to let the population recover."
 UKS_loyalty_of_france_title: "Favour of the French"
 UKS_loyalty_of_france_desc: "A subject that resents their monarch is not a subject at all, but rather a revolt in the making. A philosopher in Italy by the name of Machiavelli has recently published works regarding earning the favor of one's subjects. We should rule in equal parts benevolent and mercilessly."
 UKS_recover_france_title: "Aid France"
 UKS_recover_france_desc: "The war has taken its toll on both sides. While we have managed to recover from the dreadful conflict, the French lie exhausted and bereaved, caught up in the horrors of war. As the new overlords of France, we cannot allow their struggle to continue. Aiding the French will show their nobility that we are not the tyrants they believe, but custodians that will take care of their wealth better than they will."
 UKS_the_isles_title: "Terra Britannica"
 UKS_the_isles_desc: "We cannot focus our full attention to continental affairs whilst the Scots and Irish pose a constant threat. Perhaps it is time to bring the Isles fully under English control, once and for all."
 UKS_cultures_of_France_title: "French Civilization"
 UKS_cultures_of_France_desc: "Contrary to the status of oxymoron, French civilization is both rather advanced, and relatively civilized compared to the barbaric traditions of their neighbors. In all fairness, there are far worse fates than accepting the French as our own."
 UKS_bromance_title: "Friendship"
 UKS_bromance_desc: "Perhaps the Franks are naught but our natural allies, contrary to our prior assumptions. They oppose us to some extent, but only in all fairness. Perhaps we should attempt a more diplomatic approach to the Frankish question."
 UKS_develop_france_title: "Develop France"
 UKS_develop_france_desc: "If we are to foster a positive relationship with the Franks, we should prove we have their best interests at heart. A kind hand would do the job."
 UKS_develop_french_lands_title: "Religious Cohesion"
 UKS_develop_french_lands_desc: "Our future plans require a healthy relationship with France. Hundreds of years of rivalry have damaged our ties severely, yet we seem to have been able to repair this prolonged tear. Before finally solidifying the union, we must ensure that the final step, religious unity, is achieved."
 UKS_our_possessions_title: "English Possessions"
 UKS_our_possessions_desc: "The French are our people now to do with what we please. With their spirit tempered to suit our needs, we need but utilize such an attitude. Potential piques the brim of France, of which we needn't shun, but embrace for the gain of all."
 UKS_quell_down_title: "Quell the Rebellions"
 UKS_quell_down_desc: "It would seem as though the pride of France goes unhindered. In fact, our recent actions have done naught but spur and kindle the flames of French nationalism and resistance. Such notions are dangerous and should be treated with care. Our rightfully claimed lands rise, thus we must lower them."
 UKS_Palace_title: "The Great Palace"
 UKS_Palace_desc: "Both the French and English know great amounts regarding architecture. We ourselves host great feats of engineering, mostly hosted from London, but the French provide a more elegant touch to a hardy style, stemming from the gothic constructions originating there. If we were to combine such machinations of man, we might construct a palace worthy of our dual monarchy. Such an action may pay tribute to the insurmountable ego of the Franks, perhaps bringing forth greater cooperation and, perhaps, temper the grand rebellions that undoubtedly brew."
 UKS_brittany_title: "Conquer Brittany"
 UKS_brittany_desc: "These vile and traitorous Britons thought they could escape our wrath, guarded by naught but water. As our sphere of influence grows, Brittany refuses to yield, thus they must be met with the force they undoubtedly plan to give."
 UKS_anjou_title: "Origin of D'Anjou"
 UKS_anjou_desc: "Our grand empire of Angevin stems from the ideas of Anjou, the supposed seat of such an empire. As this idea comes to fruition, they shall gladly join the nation we toiled tirelessly to create."
 UKS_extend_possessions_title: "Expand Terra Gallica"
 UKS_extend_possessions_desc: "The French lands of mainland Europe did not lie solely under Valois rule. The House of Bourgogne, among several others, controlled substantial French lands, some of which have not made their way into our grasp. We need to reclaim these lands that are rightfully ours."
 UKS_Provence_title: "Provencal Menace"
 UKS_Provence_desc: "Provence poses as the natural ally of France, yet opposes our legitimacy as their monarch. Their hypocrisy is a stain on our reputation, which cannot go unpunished. Their unique position near Genoa will help to supplement our income, while at the same time bolstering ourselves as the true France as well as England."
 UKS_Burgundy_title: "Duchy of Burgundy"
 UKS_Burgundy_desc: "The Burgundians have tested our patience for long enough. We cannot allow another to claim the mantle of France, for we are their monarch. All French lands shall be incorporated into our realm."
 UKS_Lorraine_title: "Conquer Lorraine"
 UKS_Lorraine_desc: "Among the last Valois strongholds, the lands of Lorraine and Barrois oppose us at every turn, going as far as claiming our throne. We cannot allow these insults to stand, thus we shall claim the industrial might of Lorraine as our own, bringing France all but completely under our control."
 UKS_Savoyard_title: "Take Savoie"
 UKS_Savoyard_desc: "The ancient French claims in Savoie would prove invaluable for further expeditions into Italy. We cannot pass up such an opportunity."
 UKS_Flanders_title: "Prospering Coast"
 UKS_Flanders_desc: "The European Coastline hosts numerous merchant societies such as those of Holland. Such mercantile establishments present both threats and opportunities for the expansion of our commerce. If left to their own devices, they might outcompete our noble merchants. On the other hand, such people would provide for decent sources of income under our control."
 UKS_low_countries_title: "The Low Countries"
 UKS_low_countries_desc: "The Bourgogne menace, though hindered, it not fully defeated. Remnants of their vast realm remain in the Netherlands and Low Countries, each refusing to support our claim to the French throne and raiding our nearby settlements. Such tactics are those of a coward, thus they will be treated as such."
 UKS_union_title: "Acts of Union"
 UKS_union_desc: "Until now, we haven't a true union with the Franks. We claim to be their monarch, yet we are two separate kingdoms, rather than a single empire. This must change; our peoples must become one."
 UKS_uaval_power_title: "Naval Might"
 UKS_uaval_power_desc: "Divided by the Channel, our Realm is split between two landmasses that have massive coasts. Due to this, over the ages we have amassed experience in seafaring. With this Naval Tradition, we need to project it onto others, hence we need to become a true naval power."
 UKS_brest_arsenal_title: "The Brest Arsenal"
 UKS_brest_arsenal_desc: "With a grand navy comes great responsobility. Each ship need its own crew and maintenance. With this comes the problem with havens for ships, for we can't host all ships at the seas all the time. That's why we need to fund highly specialized naval ports to help in our naval endeavors. And of the atlantic ambitions of ours, we need to have a large port on western cape of some sort. The Breton port of Brest will do well in this role."
 UKS_wessex_ports_title: "Strategic Ports"
 UKS_wessex_ports_desc: "The west coast of Britain is ill-prepared for future maritime ventures. Through strategic expenditure, we might find these ports to be more than suitable to our needs."
 UKS_major_cherbourg_title: "Cherbourg Harbor"
 UKS_major_cherbourg_desc: "Among the closest points in Europe to Britain is Cherbourg, perfectly suited for naval ventures further into the continent."
 UKS_taxation_title: "Taxation with Representation"
 UKS_taxation_desc: "The people cry for representation in Parliament, and we cannot delay in providing it. We have long since taxed the continental peoples without allowing them seating in the House of Commons. This must change."
 UKS_develop_13_title: "Invest in the Future"
 UKS_develop_13_desc: "We know not what the future holds, but we are aware of the dire consequences that await if we are not prepared for calamity and opportunity alike."
 UKS_english_cot_title: "Expand Trade Sector"
 UKS_english_cot_desc: "Continental trade, through use of caravans, is remarkably profitable for all parties involved, though especially us. Colonial profits arrive in Bordeaux and make their way to the Channel through France. We could make good use of this opportunity."
 UKS_monopolize_the_channel_title: "Monopolize the Channel"
 UKS_monopolize_the_channel_desc: "The English Channel obtained its nomenclature righteously and we shall continue to prove such. The Channel is ours to control, and control it we shall."
 UKS_expand_production_sector_title: "Exploit our Monopoly"
 UKS_expand_production_sector_desc: "With near-absolute control over the Channel, the time has come to 'make use' of this monopoly. Such abuse may anger those who stand to lose profits,  but perhaps the game was rigged from the start."
 UKS_revitalize_title: "Revitalize Paris-Provence"
 UKS_revitalize_desc: "France still has not recovered from the tumultuous situation we forced upon them. Perhaps through such means of peace we might renew all, from Paris to Provence."
 UKS_via_gallica_title: "Construct the Via Gallica"
 UKS_via_gallica_desc: "The famous route of Via Gallica, weaved like a web through Italy, shall reach through to France and bring the wealth of Genoa alongside the merchants that make use of its hardy brick."
 UKS_via_catalunya_title: "The Via Batavica"
 UKS_via_catalunya_desc: "Further expansion of the Via Gallica road network through our Dutch holdings will be essential for further mercantile interests in the region. We should ensure the proper allocation of funds to this project."
 UKS_via_gallica_expanded_title: "Via Britannica"
 UKS_via_gallica_expanded_desc: "Via Gallica may stretch far and long throughout France, but the time is nigh to expand its reach to such important areas as our own isles."
 UKS_genoese_trade_title: "Struggle in Genoa"
 UKS_genoese_trade_desc: "Our mercantile ambitions face competition at the hands of the Genoese merchants, battling us at every opportunity. We must break their stranglehold on the Mediterranean as quickly as possible."
 UKS_toulon_title: "Toulon Shipyard"
 UKS_toulon_desc: "As our influence in the Mediterranean grows, so too does our need for naval superiority and security in the region. The city of Toulon offers great infrastructure for such necessities."
 UKS_merchants_of_marseille_title: "Merchants of Marseille"
 UKS_merchants_of_marseille_desc: "Marseille has always been an important city for both trade and immigration. Controlling the province allows us to expand our reach farther than ever before. As such, we must see to its well-being."
 UKS_oxbridge_title: "Support the Oxbridge"
 UKS_oxbridge_desc: "The universities that have arisen from both Oxford and Cambridge are perhaps the most prestigious in the world. We would do well to support their continued prosperity for our own sake as much as theirs."
 UKS_land_of_unis_title: "Land of Universities"
 UKS_land_of_unis_desc: "Europe is the global center of intellect, and we shall ensure we are the intellectual center of Europe. Such a feat would be best accomplished with systematic schooling through state-funded universities."
 UKS_dutch_unis_title: "Dutch Research"
 UKS_dutch_unis_desc: "The Dutch are a proud and intellectual people. We would do well to support their research projects for our own benefit."
 UKS_Catalonia_title: "Conquer Catalonia"
 UKS_Catalonia_desc: "With the realms united, it is time we set out to expand our influence over The Continent. With our current situation, it is certain an incursion into Iberia is necessary. The local Spanish Kingdoms are growing powerful and they must be curbed down. Catalonia under us will be a thorn in their side which will effectively render them weak against us."
 UKS_overpower_title: "Overpower the Empire"
 UKS_overpower_desc: "To our east lies the petty Holy Roman Empire. Under the leadership of current emperor, they are weak and divided. We need to show that none of them, not even the emperor, can match our strength and then take the crown for ourselves or deal the final blow."
 UKS_elector_support_title: "Electoral Support"
 UKS_elector_support_desc: "The path of the emperorship has been chosen. We need to gain the support of the electors, and tend over this scattered flock."
 UKS_the_emperor_title: "The Shepherd"
 UKS_the_emperor_desc: "Just like our Lord tends his sheep, so shall we tend the Holy Roman States."
 UKS_challange_italians_title: "Claims in Italy"
 UKS_challange_italians_desc: "The Legacy that the French have left us is imperceptibly rich. The inheritance also includes a weak claim to the Neapolitan Kingdom. This petty little kingdom, previously controlled by the Spanish and the Italians, must fall to our influence. Even if it means war."
 UKS_naples_title: "Neapolitan Dominion"
 UKS_naples_desc: "Said and shall be done. We have openly declared our ambitions to take the Neapolitan throne and we shall not back down. Instead, we shall achieve great victories like we have did in the days of old."
 UKS_destroy_hre_title: "Destroy the Empire"
 UKS_destroy_hre_desc: "Supported by his petty vassals, the puny Holy Roman Empire has always meddled in our affairs. This case shall be no more, for if there is no Empire, there will be no Emperor." 
 UKS_Lombardy_title: "Subdue Lombardy"
 UKS_Lombardy_desc: "Lombardy is our gateway to Italy. We cannot let loose of our grip on these lands, therefore they must be fully integrated into the Angevin Realm."
 UKS_genoa_title: "Mediterranean Trade"
 UKS_genoa_desc: "With Lombardy subdued, we ought to move down the peninsula and conquer the lands necessary for the prosperity of our merchant caste. While our claims may not be strong, we have to explain them before our enemies consolidate."
 UKS_Canada_title: "Colonize Canada"
 UKS_Canada_desc: "A recent expedition into the Northern region of America brings back tales of endless furs: soft gold of unparalleled quantity and quality. With such supply, we might yet break the Russian monopoly on the important commodity. We must send forth colonists at once."
 UKS_Nieuw_amsterdam_title: "Found Nieuw Amsterdam"
 UKS_Nieuw_amsterdam_desc: "Expansion is necessary to ensure the defense of our colonial empire from possible contenders. No man possesses greater will than a Brit, which we shall soon show. The Hudson River shall serve as the root of our new colony."
 UKS_Boston_title: "Rise of Trimountaine" #later renamed to Boston
 UKS_Boston_desc: "Of the many rivers that flow from the heartland of America, the Boston Harbor already serves as a major trade center for English merchants, despite our lack of control. We should provide this security before other colonists catch wind."
 UKS_found_new_orleans_title: "Nouvelle Orleans"
 UKS_found_new_orleans_desc: "Effectively dividing America in two, the mighty Mississippi River is vital to control of Caribbean trade, and thus we should assert dominance in the region."
 UKS_colonization_title: "The Unknown Frontiers"
 UKS_colonization_desc: "A combination of exploration and colonization must take place to ensure the growth of our colonial empire. At this point, much of the world remains unknown to us, which we must rectify at once."
 UKS_colonize_caribbean_title: "Caribbean Colony"
 UKS_colonize_caribbean_desc: "The Caribbean has immense potential for cultivation of crops typically unavailable in Europe. This, plus its pristine location for importing slaves from Africa make it the ideal colony to supplement our income."
 UKS_contest_brazil_title: "Contest Brazil"
 UKS_contest_brazil_desc: "Much like the Caribbean, Brazil has immense potential for sugar plantations. The average peasant's diet involved very little flavor. Perhaps we should sweeten the deal for our people."
 UKS_quebec_title: "Found Quebec"
 UKS_quebec_desc: "The French propose a Canadian colony stemming from the St. Laurence River. Though we shan't oppose such an idea, should we truly allow the French to spearhead this operation?"
 UKS_toronto_title: "The Colony of Toronto"
 UKS_toronto_desc: "The small settlement of Toronto is currently not under formal British occupation. Despite this, it sits in the perfect location for asserting control in Southern Canada. We must take the lead and begin colonization."
 UKS_denounce_title: "Denounce the Pirates"
 UKS_denounce_desc: "Privateers-turned-pirates plague the seven seas, plundering from Englishman and Frenchman alike. Though we have allowed them to roam thusfar, their actions are unforgiveable."
 UKS_curb_title: "Curb Down the Pirates"
 UKS_curb_desc: "Colonial piracy, though on the decay, still plagues all who trade in the Caribbean. We cannot allow such losses to continue. Curbing the pirates will be essential for future operations."
 UKS_west_africa_title: "Scramble for Africa"
 UKS_west_africa_desc: "With the dawn of industrialization nigh, the demand for raw materials has never been higher. The New World, though complimentary, will not properly supply our manufactories. We require additional minerals, and thus we must look to Africa."
 UKS_india_title: "Indian Trade Company"
 UKS_india_desc: "India hosts fields of spice and opium, both of which will be essential for further trade in Asia. It is time to grant some strategic monopolies to ensure our interests in South Asia are met with little resistance."
 UKS_full_india_title: "An Indian Dominion"
 UKS_full_india_desc: "India is a vast peninsula, one of such size that we cannot fully integrate it into our patrimony. Thankfully, local governance seems to be an option."
 UKS_ivory_coast_title: "Coast of Ivory"
 UKS_ivory_coast_desc: "Elephants and rhinoceroses roam free across Africa. The Ivory Coast holds significant hosts of such beasts, but its true value lies in its immense trade potential."
 UKS_cape_title: "Cape of Good Hope"
 UKS_cape_desc: "Rounding the bend of Africa has never been easier with local settlements in the Cape providing rest and refuge. We should formally incorporate this region into our empire before continuing."
 UKS_east_african_title: "Mozambique Channel"
 UKS_east_african_desc: "The land of Mozambique is rich and plentiful with gold and ivory. We stand with nothing but gain."
 UKS_indochina_title: "Conquer Indochina"
 UKS_indochina_desc: "The land of Indochina is perhaps the richest in the world, with fields of spices to send back home. The people will rejoice."
 UKS_spices_title: "Control the Spice Trade"
 UKS_spices_desc: "European diets typically consisted of primarily cereal grains, with a possibility of fish or wine as a treat. Even though the introduction of the potato added a new core to their diets, Europeans still lacked flavor. Spices and salts were the main ways to counteract such disgust."
 UKS_down_under_title: "Australian Colony"
 UKS_down_under_desc: "Australia, though of little true value, could easily serve as a penal colony for those convicted of minor crimes such as theft or blasphemy."
 UKS_inner_canada_title: "Inner Canada"
 UKS_inner_canada_desc: "With fur supplies running short along coastal Canada, we must push further into the continent."
 UKS_louisianian_colony_title: "Lousianian Colony"
 UKS_louisianian_colony_desc: "Colonial Louisiana is a land steeped in mystery and misery. Though the latter is intimidating, we would be foolhardy not to expand to such a region. Who knows of what riches we might discover inland?"

The French too flaunted their staple, which was, at the time, their Musketeers of the Guard. French musketeer tactics exceeded what other nations thought possible. By combining the best aspects of the redcoats and musketeers, we might yet produce the greatest infantry unit to ever exist."

Unsurprisingly, the French citizenry isn't satisfied with the terms of the Second Treaty of Tours and is now launching deadly attacks on the English Administration in the region. This obviously cannot stand, and therefore we must decide what to do with the vile scum on the mainland."

 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.b: "They can handle it themselves."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.t: "The Reign of Edward IV"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.d: "Edward was an extremely capable and daring military commander. He crushed the opposing house during the War of the Roses in a series of spectacular victories. Domestically, Edward restored order and civility, cracked down on banditry and piracy. Edward was also an incredibly successful businessman and merchant, heavily investing in several corporations within the City of London."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the rightful [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.b: "He will make a wonderful King"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.t: "Evolution of the English Culture"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.1: "§GEnglish and French Culture remain unchanged§!. Alongside our union of monarch, our French and English holdings show little intermingling, resulting in a completely divided populace. Even within mostly shared cities, English residents typically settle in close proximity to other Englishmen, as with the French. As a result, cultural exchange seems foolhardy at best to think about."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.2: "§GOne may find traces of cultures blending§!. With the passing of time, so too passes intolerance and ignominy. The French, despite their bitter defeat, have started to acclimate to their new conditions, as have the English. As such occurs, diffusion also occurs, and one may observe several linguistic anomalies already in Normand, which we predict will make their way onto the English mainland in due time."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.3: "§GLanguages loaning words from each other becomes visible in daily life§!. Though a linguistically complex and redundant language, French, nevertheless, has begun to loan out words and phrases to its English counterpart, spurring the diffusion process. Instead of in pound sterling, Englishmen now purchase goods with livre."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.4: "§GFrench influence may be seen in the English Court§!. Though foreign influence is typically an unwanted occurrence, the influencers at hand mean us no harm. The French, through careful political maneuvers, have begun to influence our court. If it were any other nation, we would be up in arms, but seeing as the French have relinquished themselves to their rightful place at our side, we may rest easy."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.5: "§GLanguages start to borrow grammar from each other§!. Grammar between English and French, though similar in some ways, is resoundingly different in others. It would seem as though the aforementioned similarities have begun to shine through, as grammar from one language becomes substituted for the other's. Though this trend is worrying, we should sit by and see where it takes us."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.6: "§GEnglish idioms start to leak into French Language§!. Before, English idioms had forever been part of our identity, kept within our walls and held dearly. With the new turn of cultural diffusion, however, we have begun to see more and more Frenchmen use these phrases, practically robbed from us. Though unsettling, they do no harm, thus we cannot act."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.7: "§GSpeakers of English Accent can be seen in France and vice versa§!. English and French speaking diverged from a young age due to the English Channel presenting difficulties for intercommunication. That divergence has begun to mend as we bridge said channel, bringing both our peoples and our languages closer together. Even now, one may notice Englishmen speaking with a French accent and vice versa."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.8: "§GImpact of English language can be easily seen in the French Aristocratic Language§!. The language of the elite has always differed from the language of the peasantry. That being said, on a political scale, all of England is the aristocracy, and the French are the subjugated serfs. As such, many of our common terms can be easily seen in the French aristocracy's way of speaking, bringing us to believe they have recognized our language as fully superior."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.9: "§GFrench Grammar heavily influenced by English§!. Grammar is an interesting issue to mull over, but in recent events, we are not sure which grammar to be using. With more and more linguistic culture arriving from England, the French grammar is merely a husk of what it used to be."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.10: "§GFrench is more comparable to Germanic languages than to its Romance cousins§!. We have noticed a trend. Not a positive one, nor a negative, but a trend nonetheless. Though French has long since been an ancestor of Latin, it would seem as though it has undergone a shift from its Romance origins to one of Germanic tongue, seemingly stemming from our conquest of the region. Though the Spaniards and French never shared much linguistic commonalities, any similarities are now gone."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.a: "Okay."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.4.t: "The Culmination of Language Evolution"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.4.d: "With decades of cultural blending the French Cultures have finally been brought closer to their English Overlords. English, previously influenced by French, has now made a massive impact on the French Cultures of the Continent. The French can now consider them as our brethren."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.4.a: "Interesting Development!"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.t: "Location for the Grand Palace"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.d: "To further solidify the union, we shall build a grand palace blah blah blah. Time to pick a site for it."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.a: "[Root.Capital.GetName]! [Root.Capital.GetName] is the ideal site as it is the center of the Empire."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.b: "Famous city of [FRA.Capital.GetName] should do the job."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.c: "Let the lottery decide."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.t: "Grand Palace Built"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.d: "The toiling labor of the peasantry has halted. The palace stands tall above the skyline, casting a daunting shadow upon the city it imposes upon. Perfect. Such a marvel of architecture shall stand above the commoners, displaying our grandeur. Their taxes and labor shine bright in the form of a palace fit for an emperor. Though grand, work might yet continue. Should we proceed with the expansion?"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.a: "Our coffers shall run light this day!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.b: "The French might be persuaded to fund such a venture."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.c: "No need to risk damaging its current beauty."

 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.t: "The Case for the Bretons"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.d: "The Bretons have different language and different customs from their neighbors in France nor they are similar to people in England. This of course poses a significant problem as they can become a thorn in our side."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.a: "Persecution leads nowhere, we need to let them be."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.b: "If they will be scared, they will change their ways faster."

 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.9.t: "Breton Rebellion"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.9.d: "As it seems, the petty Bretons haven't been content with our rulership and with that reasoning they dared to rebel against us. This will not be tolerated. They think that backstabbing us in our times of hardship will earn them their independence, though they do not understand that noone betrays the [Root.Dynasty.GetName]."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.9.a: "We shall slaughter them like the pigs that they are."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.10.t: "Breton Migration"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.10.d: "The rebellions of the Bretons havent aided them in anything. With that in mind, the Bretons are fleeing to our colonies to escape the persecution they are 'supposedly' facing under our rule. Fools they are, but their presence in the colonies may be beneficial to us..."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.10.a: "This is not ideal... or is it?"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.11.t: "Bretons Integrate"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.11.d: "The peace and prosperity our reign has brought to the Bretons have convinced them that the [Root.Adjective.GetName] rule isn't all that bad as they initially thought. In this peaceful environment, many Bretons have decided to change their customs to be more alike to the one practiced in the East."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.11.a: "Marvelous!"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.12.t: "Catalan March"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.12.d: "Catalonia is the frontier between France and the rest of Iberia. Birthplace of many conflicts, it remains a province that is constantly devastated by border skirmishes. Due to that, the local populace become so militarized the land may now be considered a march of ours."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.12.a: "Send a governor that will rule it in our name."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.12.b: "Direct control over the march is preferable."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.t: "Royal Universities"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.d: "Although the University of Cambridge was given a royal charter in 1231, and similar privileges were given to Oxford in 1248, the universities still request further grants, likely due to the growing influence of French universities of the same ilk. We can, of course, satisfy these demands and give the English scholars extra support, but maintaining the current status quo may lead to greater acceptance of foreign schooling."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.a: "Grant additional privileges to English universities"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.b: "We should embrace education equally throughout our grand empire"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.14.t: "Italian Coalition"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.14.d: "With the inheritance of the Kingdom of France, we also inherited its claims on Southern Italy, which we shall use to their fullest extent. This will be no easy conflict, and we can expect severe resistance from both the Italians and major powers with interest in the region."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.14.a: "We shall fight the Italian Wars for our rightful claims!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.14.b: "Perhaps a series of smaller wars would be wiser."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.15.t: "End of the Italian Wars"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.15.d: "Above each desolate city doth our banner rise high, in each rich abode doth reside our people. The Italians wars have concluded, and we are victorious. With complete control over England, France, and Italy secured, we have become perhaps the most powerful nation in Europe, with only prosperity remaining in the future."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.15.a: "Huzzah!"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.t: "End of the Italian Wars"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.d: "The Angevin claims over Italian holdings have spurred along a long, dreadfully deadly conflict that has taken its toll on our populace. Bereaved mothers, still weeping from the losses of their sons, suffer now more than ever, knowing the sacrifice their darling children made was all for naught. As the country's manpower dwindles beyond exhaustion, there are few to no men to work on the fields that were once sustaining our populace. The resulting famines kill thousands each day, likely due to the massive taxes we were forced to implement. As our enemies enforce substantial war reparations upon us, there is no way the state can afford to aid the people in these tumultuous times."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.a: "The state will take time to recover."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.t: "Containment Breach"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.d: "Our enemies were not expecting our sudden victory over the French. For centuries, next generations of foreign powers worked together to keep the balance of power in check and not to let our state get too dominant. But with the English lineage secured on the French throne, this ancient balance of power has been destroyed and our foes are looking into creating a coalition that will end our dominance in France."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.a: "En Garde!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.b: "Send out spies to sabotage their actions!"
