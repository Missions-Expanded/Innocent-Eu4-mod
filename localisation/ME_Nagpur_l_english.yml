 nagpur_develop_the_capital_title: "Developments in Nagpur"
 nagpur_develop_the_capital_desc: "Nagpur itself is still a young city with many families moving in and construction projects actively working to make the city beautiful and functional. Focusing our efforts on it so that it can become an administrative, cultural, and military center will bolster our progress toward making an imperial capital in Central India, and what good is an imperial capital without a proper fortress anyways?"
 nagpur_culture_and_religion_title: "Social Cohesiveness"
 nagpur_culture_and_religion_desc: "Despite our progress as a unified state, the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi still get into disputes and feuds regarding religion and tradition. Our officials can try to keep order on a local level, but continuing feuds have spiraled into riots and revolts the likes of which are very destructive to several communities. We must take action and we must impose order as much as we can by cooperating with some groups and exiling others, but we must never turn away those who are our true kin."
 nagpur_take_andhra_title: "Strike at Andhra"
 nagpur_take_andhra_desc: "To the south along the coast are the Telugu people. They are a distinct and tough group of people and have carved out their own nations in the past, but their power wanes now as their dynastic lines wither and their military power dwindles. Let us strike at one of the last independent bastions of Telugu resistance, Andhra, and seize the land for ourselves."
 nagpur_the_bengal_delta_title: "Bengal's Last Stand"
 nagpur_the_bengal_delta_desc: "The Bengali Sultanate and those other smaller states of Bengali culture have sought to exert control over the coasts and inland, but have struggled to do so in the past. Now that that Nagpur is surging with power and might, the Bengalis suddenly find themselves on a much more equal play field against us. Let us deliver unto them their final blow and win this centuries-long conflict."
 nagpur_assam_and_koch_title: "Venturing North"
 nagpur_assam_and_koch_desc: "What the Bengali Sultanate sought to control in the north were the states at the seat of the great mountains in the north and the states that lie in the jungles to the northeast. Nagpur officials do see these states as viable threats to our new borders in the north and if they are successful at raiding our land, we could see ourselves lose control over the Bengal Region itself. Thus, we are tasked with asserting dominance over the northern states and integrating the Bengal Delta region into Nagpur more so that our power is secured."
 nagpur_harsh_land_cultivation_title: "Harsh Land Cultivation"
 nagpur_harsh_land_cultivation_desc: "The forests and jungles of our heartland are not easy to make useful since they require great amounts of effort and manpower to work. Draining areas of water, chopping down groves of trees, and levelling out land for further usage are all required for us to make once untamed land into something useful and in the end, it will be worth the effort."
 nagpur_three_part_military_title: "Three-Part Military"
 nagpur_three_part_military_desc: "In Nagpur, there is a sense of unity that goes beyond just mere communities and local administrations. We see this unity display itself on several levels throughout Nagpur but we have yet to see it displayed in the military. Our three principle groups of people, the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi, still vie for ultimate power in the military which leads to mishaps and disputes that are often hard to deal with. We must put in the effort to stop this and promote unity here as well; formulating a solid plan of a triple-sectioned military that comprises of all three people groups should help lay the foundation for us."
 nagpur_telugu_takeover_title: "Telugu Takeover"
 nagpur_telugu_takeover_desc: "The Telugu people are no longer able to maintain themselves like before, what with the fall of Andhra and the coast being seized already. We must finish the job and take over the entirety of Telugu-held land so that Nagpur may have an open corridor of expansion into other places."
 nagpur_become_overlords_title: "Turn the Tide"
 nagpur_become_overlords_desc: "No longer are the three oppressed people of the subcontinent subjects of foreign powers! They are united and stronger than ever before, but that does not mean the unified state of Nagpur needs no allies nor subjects. To exert outward influence and to ensure our safety, we should be looking to have subject states beneath us and strong allies abroad who can can come to the aid of Nagpur should times call for it."
 nagpur_economic_overhaul_title: "Economic Overhaul"
 nagpur_economic_overhaul_desc: "With our economy seeing a steady rise in production and the Vaishya Caste steadily becoming more fruitful in their contribution to the overall prosperity of Nagpur, we are ready to shift things even more and begin the process of overhauling traditional methods of production. Doing so will require great amounts of money and the trust of a great many people, but in time this effort will come back to repay us in the form of a stronger and more robust economy."
 nagpur_dominate_bengali_trade_title: "Stabilize Bengali Trade"
 nagpur_dominate_bengali_trade_desc: "The destruction of the Bengali Sultanate has come at a slight cost to Nagpur in terms of manpower and resources, but the profits are going to far outweigh what we once paid. The trade routes into and out of the region are like no other and once granted the sultans enormous amounts of wealth and power, but they squandered it all during their time in power. Nagpur will do better with such trade revenue, but first we needs to ensure that the trade actually flows in ways that are beneficial for Nagpur as a whole."
 nagpur_trunk_road_entrance_title: "Northern Tensions"
 nagpur_trunk_road_entrance_desc: "To our north are the domains of Jaunpur and those similar to it. They have not tried to make incusions against us yet, but we should not wait for them to do so. We must take action before they can make any move against us and secure a firm hold on the Grand Trunk Road."
 nagpur_toward_delhi_title: "To Take Delhi"
 nagpur_toward_delhi_desc: "Following the path northward, we see that there is a lot of potential for future conquests, but these cities are valuable in more ways than one and must be preserved as much as possible when we invade for them. Places like Kannauj and Delhi may be sources of power against Nagpur, but they are not strong enough to defy us for long. The battle for Northern India must and will be won by Nagpur."
 nagpur_fleet_ambitions_title: "Nagpuri Ships"
 nagpur_fleet_ambitions_desc: "With the legacy of a strong navy still present in Bengali administrators and locals, Nagpuri officials are beginning to see things from their perspective. Sure, our dominance of trade routes in and around the Bengal Delta is good, but we must ensure that it is always protected as well! What good is ocean trade if part or all of it gets plundered by privateers or destroyed by enemy fleets?"
 nagpur_seize_punjab_title: "Close off the Khyber"
 nagpur_seize_punjab_desc: "With much of the heart of Northern India under our control, many Nagpuri officials are pointing out that we must obtain some of the final pieces of the north in order to secure India's entrance: the Khyber Pass. Once we take over the pass itself and also the places it leads directly into, we can proclaim ourselves as the true unifiers of Northern India."
 nagpur_arakan_ports_title: "Succeed where they Failed"
 nagpur_arakan_ports_desc: "For a very long time, Arakan and and its neighbors down south have been hubs of piracy that drain away Bengali trade power. The Sultanate attempted to deal with these threats, but only managed curtail them for a short time before they were actively pursuing their own interests again. It is time that Nagpur did what the sultans could not do and officially end the pirate ports in the east."
 nagpur_vijayanagar_invasion_title: "Overthrow the Sangamas!"
 nagpur_vijayanagar_invasion_desc: "Southern India has not known true peace in ages; some say that it will never know peace at all, but we can change that. The Sangama Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire (founded by the brothers Harihara I and Bukka Raya I in 1336) has held power for a long time after the fall of the Hoysala Empire in about 1343, but their control is not universal, not yet at least. We need to strike a fatal blow at the heart of this empire before it can grow further and rival us even more."
 nagpur_bahmanid_invasion_title: "Destroy the Bahmanids!"
 nagpur_bahmanid_invasion_desc: "The revolt of former Delhi general Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah in 1347 proved successful and the Bahamani Sultanate was established in the heart of the Deccan Plateau. This Shiite Sultanate is what we currently must contend with in our current situation and though they are powerful, they are not invincible. Since its inception, the Bahmanids have fought against the Sangamas for control over the Southern Deccan meaning that we can use this consistent conflict as a way for Nagpur to invade and seize the capital of Bidar and more."
 nagpur_malvi_invasion_title: "Strike down the Khalji!"
 nagpur_malvi_invasion_desc: "When the Delhi Sultanate was in a steep decline, several governors and military officers broke off and formed their own states, one of them being the Malwa Sultanate founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri. After being overthrown by Mahmud Khalji in May of 1436 and establishing the Khalji Dynasty, it became a serious power in the region and now it remains a threat to Nagpur to this day. Seizing Mandu and destroying the Malwa Sultanate once and for all is the only way we can resolve this matter."
 nagpur_the_marathas_title: "Control over Maharashtra"
 nagpur_the_marathas_desc: "The question the Marathas pose to us of Nagpur is a large one as they make up a decent portion of the population on the western cost just south of Gujarati lands and north of Tamil lands. They are fearless and resourceful people who will fight for their independence at every turn if they are mistreated, but we of Nagpur will ensure that this sentiment is curtailed in a myriad of ways. The Marathi people will be integral to the rise of Nagpur!"
 OWNS_ALL_MARATHI_PROVINCES_IN_ASIA: "§O[This.GetName] must own all provinces in India of Marathi culture.§!"
 nagpur_tamil_invasion_title: "Into the Jungles"
 nagpur_tamil_invasion_desc: "The lands of Southern India are very hard to maintain control over as the Sangamas saw firsthand. Tamil and Malayalam alike find it easy to maintain autonomy in South India because of the natural terrain and environment, but the crucial ports they hold mean that this autonomy must be taken away."
 nagpur_konkan_ports_title: "A Sword to the West"
 nagpur_konkan_ports_desc: "With Bahmanis put to our sword and dealt with, we must look toward the western ports on the Konkan coast. This was the site of great tension between the Hindus of Vijayanagar and the Muslims of Bahmanis, but now that power in the Deccan is in the capable hands of Nagpur, we can end this tension once and for all and secure the ports for ourselves. The hand of Vijayanagar may want it, but our sword will slice at them without mercy!"
 nagpur_coastal_gujarat_title: "Of Gujarat and Saurashtra"
 nagpur_coastal_gujarat_desc:  "The region of Gujarat and its neighboring area of Saurashtra are contentious but also prosperous in the amount of trade revenue they bring in. In times past, the region has given rise to powerful states that claimed hegemony in Western India, battling the rajputs in the north for dominance in the region but this time must come to an end. With our ports on the Konkan coast and our armies at the ready, we must seize the coast of the region and push north toward the Indus River Delta, securing all of Western Indian trade for ourselves."
 nagpur_rajput_lands_title: "The Question of Rajputana"
 nagpur_rajput_lands_desc: "Rajput land is not as valuable in terms of trade or production of materials, they are valuable for another reason entirely: the martial prowess of the people themselves. Previous iterations of Western India saw powerful rajput kingoms rise up and fight for dominance in the region, but internal strife and division has proven to be the downfall of the rajput people. Nagpur must and will take advantage of this and subdue the rajput people for their martial skill is just what the Nagpuri military needs."
 nagpur_last_bastions_title: "Last Bastions of Resistance"
 nagpur_last_bastions_desc: "The lands across the water in Lanka are dense in vegetation like Southern India as a whole, but for a very long time it has been a haven not for Hinduism but for Theravada Buddhism instead. The states of Kotte and Kandy sought complete control over the island and its rich amount of spices, but the power they wield is very fragile. By taking control of the island once and for all and eliminating any sort of independent presence there, Nagpur will succeed where so many other states in Southern India have failed: uniting the entirety under one flag."
 nagpur_sapta_puri_title: "Sapta Puri & Bharat"
 nagpur_sapta_puri_desc: "Ever since the rise of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula and the fall of the Sassanid Empire, Islamic incursions into the subcontinent have never ceased. From the Caliphates to the Ghurids to the Ghaznavids to the Delhi Sultanate, we have seen the likes of our beautiful subcontinent ravaged by followers of this foreign faith, but this is finally at an end. With the taking and holding down of the Sapta Puri, the seven holy pilgramage sites, in India, we may proclaim ourselves the keepers and protectors of the entirety of the subcontinent."

 desc_nagpur_control_over_bengal: "The Bengali Sultanate was right to have begun building ships for itself but that did not save them from Nagpur's conquest.

 nagpur_land_cultivation: "Cultivation of Land"
 desc_nagpur_land_cultivation: "The harsh terrain by which we came from is by no means unusable.

 desc_nagpur_turned_the_tables: "Previously our people and their kin were subjects of surrounding states like Malwa, Bahmanis, and Orissa, but this is no longer the case.

 nagpur_dominating_bengali_trade: "Domination of Bengali Trade"
 desc_nagpur_dominating_bengali_trade: "With the effective integration of the Bengali lands and the subsequent dominationf of Bengali trade routes both on land out at sea, we are seeing a great surge in trade revenue. With this money, we can fund new projects and perhaps even naval expeditions down south."
 nagpur_pillars_of_north_india: "Imperial Pillars of the North"
 desc_nagpur_pillars_of_north_india: "Seats of conquerors from ages past, the cities of Delhi and Kannauj along with key points between and around them are now in the hands of Nagpur. With this grand conquest for our people and for our state, we will be known throughout all of India and beyond."

 desc_nagpur_the_trunk_road: "The fertility of the land and the lucrative trade that occurs all along the Grand Trunk Road is what helps give Northern India life and power.

 nagpur_proper_fleet: "The Nagpur Fleet"
 desc_nagpur_proper_fleet: "Traditionally we have not been one for sailing on the open water, but our integration of the Bengali people and their valuable coastal land has led to the people of Nagpur becoming more fond of the open ocean and its possibilities. Thanks to our recent efforts coupled with these rising interest amongst our people, the Fleet of Nagpur is finally a tangible thing and ready for the world at large."
 nagpur_bengali_lock_down: "Bengal Locked Down"
 desc_nagpur_bengali_lock_down: "The complete take over and locking down of Bengali trade routes by Nagpuri merchants, warriors, and administrators has resulted in a surge in economic prosperity.

 desc_nagpur_vijayanagar_conquest: "Long have the Sangamas been in power, and long will the names of the Sangama leaders be remembred... In the archives of Nagpur. Let us bask in the glory we have achieved over the great power of Southern India, successor to the Hoysala Empire, and promote a Hindu court like no other!"
 nagpur_bahamanid_conquest: "Bahmanid Capitulation"
 desc_nagpur_bahamanid_conquest: "Breaking away from the Delhi Sultanate granted the Sultanate of Bahmanis good times and a fierce competition with the Vijayanagar Empire, but such prosperous times had to be put to an end. With the great cavalry that they once fielded now in the hands of Nagpuri officers and soldiers, we will storm across the land and strike at the hearts of our enemies without the slightest hesitation!"
 nagpur_malwa_conquest: "Malvi Usurpation"
 desc_nagpur_malwa_conquest: "The Khalji Dynasty of Malwa took pride in their capital at Mandu and their fierce fighters that helped propel them to greatness, but their position near us and near other rival powers was bound to eat away at their power.

 desc_nagpur_hegemon_of_the_south: "With all of South India united under Nagpur, there are very few who can and will oppose our power.

 #Events
 ME_Nagpur_Events.1.a: "The Great Reclaimation"
 ME_Nagpur_Events.1.b: "For so long, the people of the holy sites across the subcontinent have toiled away in the midst of Islamic authorities, unable to ensure completely safe passage toward the seven sites. Nagpur has come far in seeing these holy sites reclaimed and renovated for the better with Hindus returning to them without hesitation. Our work to keep places like Ayodhya, Mathura, and Varanasi safe, prosperous, and open to all Hindus from every corner of the world shall not go unnoticed, and our devotion to the gods above will in turn give us the strength we need to go forth and stand against those who would see the subcontinent divided."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.1.c: "May the gods light our way."
 SAPTA_PURI_LOCAL_CENTERS: "§O[This.GetName] will gain rewards at each of the designated sites called tirthas.§!"
 #Title of the Event for the tirthas#
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.a: "A Piece of Sapta Puri"
 #Descriptions of each tirtha#
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.b: "The legendary place where Ramachandra was born, some call it by the name 'Ram Janmabhoomi' meaning 'Rama's birth place'. Ayodhya's significance dates back several centuries as both a political and religious center, though after the fall of Harsha's empire in the 7th-8th century it fell out of political importance to many. Religious activities persisted and this is evident by how many people we see make the journey back toward Ayodhya to witness not only the marvelous buildings but also to pray and pay homage to the temples inside the city."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.c: "Mathura has a long and extensive history that many still recount to this day. Popularly known as 'Krishnajanmabhoomi' meaning 'Krishna's birth place', Mathura experienced history dating all the back to the Vedic Period in Indian history but not only this, Muslims as well as Buddhists also call Mathura home as mosques and Buddhist temples can also be found within its limits. Nagpur's careful cultivation and control over Mathura has once again let it thrive freely with Hindus living in relative peace whilst other faiths, though in the minority, still being able to practice as they please."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.d: "According to legend, when the Lord Shiva let free the locks of his hair, the goddess Ganga descended unto Haridwar as well. With the name meaning quite literally 'gateway to the god Vishnu', it should come to no surprise that Haridwar is a hub for a great many Hindus from around the subcontinent so that they may take a holy bath in the Ganges and also pray at the various temples around the city. So many legends and tales surround the city itself and now that travel across the subcontinent is increasing to not only Haridwar, but also the other important cities in the Sapta Puri, Nagpur should be ready to embrace this coming age of prosperity."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.e: "With a detailed history dating back to the Early and Medieval Cholas, the Pallavas, and even early Buddhism, Kanchipuram serves as a pillar of Hinduism and Jainism. Several Jain acharyas (spiritual teachers) are associated with Kanchipuram and Hindu temples devoted to Shiva and Vishnu can be found here, some dating all the way back the time of the Pallavas. Since Nagpur now holds Kanchipuram in as its own and the temples and communities may be built with the infrastructure support of a strong state, Kanchipuram will flourish from now into the future."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.f: "To the credit of Varanasi, it is and has been one of the holiest sites in Hinduism for a very long time with some considering it to be the oldest inhabited city on the subctoninent. From Bhraminical learning in the past to an uncountable richly decorated temples that stood the test of time, Varanasi has been claimed as the favorite city by the Lord Shiva and perhaps even by the administrators of Nagpur itself. Let the people of Varanasi celebrate loudly and with glee, for its holy nature shall be proclaimed all throughout the subcontinent without being held back."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.g: "Dwarka is often identified by scholars around the subcontinent with the Dwarka Kingdom from ages past. Dwarka is also said to have been the first capital of Gujarat and as such contains a great amount of signficance to the people of the region and to Hindus from other places. With sevreal majestic temples lining the landscape of Dwarka and the legend of Krishna settling here after killing his uncle, Kansa, being integral to the city, Nagpur is truly honored to have the 'gateway', as its name translates to, become as prosperous as it has."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.h: "The tradition of Ujjain stretches back a long way, like many other religious sites encompassed within Sapta Puri, but the key tale for Ujjain is unlike the others. Here, Shiva is said to have triumped over the demon king Triprasura and thusly renamed the city to 'Ujjainyini' or, 'conquers with pride', and is from here that Ujjain gets at least a fair portion of its religious authority. On top of this, the works of Emperor Ashoka helped transform the city into a place of majesty, but this would not last forever unfortunately. Now that peace secure over the region, however, Ujjain may rise once again and become a hub for Hinduism along with its six other fellow sites."
