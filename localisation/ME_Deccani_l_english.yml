 #Deccani Events#
 ME_Deccani_Events.1.a: "The Successor of Bahmanis"
 ME_Deccani_Events.1.b: "With $COUNTRY$ now in firm control of the five pillars of what once held up the Sultanate of Bahmanis, there are few around in the Deccan who are willing to rise up in opposition to us. Our work is far from done and the legacy of our former overlords hailing from Bidar is daunting, but we are merely standing at the start of a great journey. With enough wit, diplomacy, administrative work, and military might, we can succeed in formalizing power in the Deccan and cultivate Deccani culture as it is currently developing."
 ME_Deccani_Events.1.c: "What was once lost, is found once more."
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.2.a: "Victory in the Raichur Doab"
 ME_Deccani_Events.2.b: "Though some on the outside think of our victory in the Raichur Doab as insignificant, in reality it is a turning point for us, a successor of the Sultanate of Bahmanis. For so long it was contested by both those who hailed from the City of Victory in the south and those who hailed from the Turquoise Throne in the north, but there is no question any longer about who is the sole authority in these fertile lands! We, the chosen successor of Bahmanis, have slain our foe in the fertile lands of the Raichur Doab and driven them out; few will be able to contest our authority in the Deccan once the rest of the splintering southern powers bow to us."
 ME_Deccani_Events.2.c: "Our might is unmatched!"
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.3.a: "Taming of the Deccan Plateau"
 ME_Deccani_Events.3.b: "Defeating our enemies in the north and south has been no easy task. We have lost thousands of soldiers to these recent wars in the Deccan and suffered in our own right, but we have remained firm and steadfast in our ambition to succeed where the Sultanate of Bahmanis failed. In our efforts to defeat the waning power of Hindu dynasties in the south and the various Muslim dynasties of the north, we have been implementing more and more diverse strategies and tactics to conquer our foes since the terrain they call home ranges from thick jungles to towering hills. These skills will not be lost on in the future, and as we take in the population from our defeated enemies, we will take in their military skills, combine them with our own, and learn to placate the entirety of the Deccan with them."
 ME_Deccani_Events.3.c: "Forward unto Dawn."
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.4.a: "The Nizam of the Deccan"
 ME_Deccani_Events.4.b: "With the entirety of the Deccan under our authority, many within our realm have begun to look inward toward the various cities that are deemed to be an essential part of our empire. From cities with great urban growth potential to cities with feeble amounts of luxuries, our viziers as well as the Brahmins we reside over who assist in administrating local communities are coming up with various ways to improve the situation throughout our empire. Some propose much needed land reforms, others support refining how we mint coins, and yet still more vocalize their backing for a number of other reforms that we can take up in the future, but there is one single thread that seems to bind all of these officials together: the need for more cultural unity and cohesion universally. Whether it is through promoting languages in formalized manners or giving legitimacy to the cultural traditions of one group of people that have been looked down upon by us in the past, our Nizam-ul-Mulk (roughly meaning 'Governor of the Realm') needs to see to it that this want for cultural unity is realized."
 ME_Deccani_Events.4.c: "Through cultural unity we will not fall."
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.5.a: "Chowmahalla Palace"
 ME_Deccani_Events.5.b: "Beautiful, is it not? Fitted with a clock tower named the 'Khilwat Clock', a beautifully crafted throne room of pure marble for the Takht-e-Nishan (royal seat) itself, and distinctly Persian style domes and arches, the time and money invested into building up the palace was not wasted in the slightest. Our tireless work conquering and consolidating the various parts of the Deccan has now been formally recognized through out construction of the Chowmahalla Palace. Meaning 'Four Palaces' in the Deccani language that our administration is promoting throughout the region, the ceremonial functions that are necessitated by our dynasty shall be held in great prestige here inside the grandiose halls and rooms. Not only this, but the administration is fit to have its own part of the palatial estate since the growing city of Hyderbad that the palace is built inside of can become a hub for goveranance. As we continue to extend our authority deeper into the communities of the Deccan, and as we continue to strive for excellence in both governing our land and protecting it from invaders, we can rest assured that our prestige and authority will be ingrained in the land through our glorious palace."
 ME_Deccani_Events.5.c: "Al Azmatulillah, all greatness is for God."
