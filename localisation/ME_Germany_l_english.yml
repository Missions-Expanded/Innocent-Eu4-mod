 germany_reintegrating_the_french_title: "Re-integrating the French"
 germany_reintegrating_the_french_desc: "The Carolingian schism has taken its toll on the entirety of Western Europe. Many soldiers and commoners have died in order to unite this long gone Empire. With out grip strengthened on the French people, we can at last start uniting the lost Empire culturally, either by the sword, or with persuasion."
 germany_fields_of_verdun_title: "Fields of Verdun"
 germany_fields_of_verdun_desc: "Verdun was the city where the Carolingian Empire was split into three parts, later known as France, Italy, and Germany. It created the Modern Franco-German borders, which led into a series of bloody conflicts. The French have declared that 'The Germans Shall NOT Pass', but little do they know that their strategies have been failing time and again opposed to us. It is time to end this cursed treaty!"
 germany_feast_in_paris_title: "Feast in Paris"
 germany_feast_in_paris_desc: "Charles the Bald may have helped Louis the Germans against Middle Francia, but he was nothing but a threat to the German population. His legacy, [FRA.GetName], is the same threat even today. After our victory at Verdun we expect them to simply vanish, cowering away behind their city walls. That will not stop our advance though...."
 germany_the_iberian_frontier_title: "The Iberian Frontier"
 germany_the_iberian_frontier_desc: "During the reign of Charlemagne, the Carolingian Empire was decisively pushing the Umayyad Caliphate out of Iberia. That advance though was stopped at his deathbed. This does not make it less of a proper Carolingian Empire land."
 germany_new_infantry_doctrine_title: "New Infantry Doctrine"
 germany_new_infantry_doctrine_desc: "Infantry is the core of every army in battle. This has been the case as technology progresses and quantity becomes more poignant. This, combined with the use of rifles can create a devastating barrage of infantry fire. The downside of it nevertheless will be increased production cost of infantry equipment. Such innovations, however, are much needed in the battlefield."
 germany_germany_above_all_title: "Germany Above All"
 germany_germany_above_all_desc: "For centuries Germany has been disunited by religious conflicts, internal issues, and foreign affairs. The idea of a united Germany was but a mere fairy tale. Many thought it was simply not possible to force unity upon the various German states, until now. Our ruler has managed to unite those states either by force or diplomacy. We must consolidate the rest of them before we can start our external expansion."
 germany_grossdeutsche_loesung_title: "Großdeutsche Lösung"
 germany_grossdeutsche_loesung_desc: "Whilst the core of the German lands have been united, there are still some other Germans that are resisting our uncontested hegemony over all of the German population. Crushing them, or peacefully subjugating them will finally allow us to form a German nation following the großdeutsche Lösung (greater German solution), thus starting our external ambitions."
 germany_plundering_the_polders_title: "Plundering the Polders"
 germany_plundering_the_polders_desc: "The Low Countries have always been German, despite their massive rebuttal against it. They even refuse us to march in their land to bypass the French fortifications. We will have to 'forcefully' make them accept our demands, even at the cost of a few hundred German souls."
 germany_revenge_for_fontenoy_title: "Revenge for Fontenoy"
 germany_revenge_for_fontenoy_desc: "Italy was the domain of Lothar I, King of Middle Francia. He was the cause for the Carolingian civil war, challenging the two Brothers at Fontenoy. Whilst his army was ultimately beaten there, both ours and the West Francian troops suffered that day. Today, we will take revenge for that."
 germany_german_conscription_system_title: "Conscription System"
 germany_german_conscription_system_desc: "The [Root.GetAdjective] population is vast, containing some of the most loyal people. By creating a conscription system, we can recruit a few thousand more men into the army, or better yet, keep them in reserve in case of a disastrous defeat against our rivals."
 germany_maneuver_warfare_title: "Maneuver Warfare"
 germany_maneuver_warfare_desc: "Sitting idly at our positions will only give the enemy both the planning and preparation time for a battle. Most [Root.GetAdjective] officers and generals have suggested that we adopt to a more mobile type of warfare, one that requires both training and equipment, but will ultimately be annihilating for our enemies. It will also require a substantial amount of firepower in order to be able to crush any opposition in our path."
 germany_partition_of_poland_title: "Partition of Poland"
 germany_partition_of_poland_desc: "Our Eastern borders are threatened by the Polish people, a nation with a proud history, and an army that can pack a punch. This will not stop us though from 'integrating' their lands to our Empire."
 germany_bolstering_the_german_economy_title: "Bolstering the Economy"
 germany_bolstering_the_german_economy_desc: "The [Root.GetAdjective] people are known as the most hardworking in all of Europe, seeking to expand their nations glory, as well as its economy. This spirit can be overburdened for our lacking economy."
 germany_preparing_high_seas_fleet_title: "Preparing the High Seas Fleet"
 germany_preparing_high_seas_fleet_desc: "We require a program of massive naval build-up to build our glorious High Seas fleet, if we are ever to challenge our rivals successfully."
 germany_the_deutsche_marine_title: "The Deutsche Marine"
 germany_the_deutsche_marine_desc: "The preparations are concluded. Our high seas fleet is ready to sail into the North Sea, as well as the Atlantic, challenging every naval enemy of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The Deutsche Marine, Terror of the Seas."
 germany_modernization_of_tactics_title: "Modernization of Tactics"
 germany_modernization_of_tactics_desc: "[Root.GetName] is home to many military experts. With a gigantic amount of manpower and resources, these men will be able to benefit us in our desire to utterly dominate the continent."
 germany_manufakturen_programm_title: "Manufakturen- Programm"
 germany_manufakturen_programm_desc: "The [Root.GetAdjective] land is lacking of Manufactories. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proposed the 'Manufakturen-Programm', a series of construction efforts in the [Root.GetAdjective] land, to be enacted. It will take a drain of both the national and the royal treasury, but in turn it will certainly be a profitable investment."
 germany_deutsch_kamerun_title: "Deutsch- Kamerun"
 germany_deutsch_kamerun_desc: "Cameroon is an important region in the Ivory Trade. It contains a convenient amount of slaves that we can use in both our homeland and the rest of our colonies."
 germany_deutsch_suedwestafrika_title: "Deutsch- Südwestafrika"
 germany_deutsch_suedwestafrika_desc: "The Slave Trade must flow! Cameroon is not able to provide us with enough slaves, thanks to our expeditiously economy. A bit South of our Western Africa colony is Namibia, a land filled with trade centers and slaves. We must swiftly colonize Namibia before the other Great Powers begin their own ambitions in that region. The natives will ultimately resist our ambitions there, but they are small in numbers, and abaft in technology."
 germany_deutsch_ostafrika_title: "Deutsch- Ostafrika"
 germany_deutsch_ostafrika_desc: "Our last Model colony, by our Colonial and Trade advisors, should be established in the region of Zanzibar, home to many natural goods, such as gems, gold, ivory, and so on. It will ultimately overextend our forces, but in return it will provide us with a massive influx of trade."
 germany_our_place_in_the_sun_title: "Our Place in the Sun"
 germany_our_place_in_the_sun_desc: "With the birth of the German nation, we can at last start observing the non-European world, planning our monumental conquests there. We have to be careful though, since the rest of the Great Powers will not be pleased by our sudden desire for German Imperialism."
 germany_kaiser_wilhelms_land_title: "Kaiser- Wilhelms-Land"
 germany_kaiser_wilhelms_land_desc: "Papua New Guinea is our gateway into Oceania. The land itself may not have any enormous value, but our presence in there not only allows us to reach nearby land, such as Terra Australis, but it will also allow us to gain influence into regions such as Japan and China. We must press our opportunity there, before it fades away."
 germany_control_australian_trade_title: "Australian Trade"
 germany_control_australian_trade_desc: "It is time we start experimentations with our newly found trade fleet. Terra Australis will be the beginning ground for those vessels, since this land is filled with gold and sugar. Our colonial rivals there will surely respond to our actions, but we have prepared for such measures already."

 GER_OWNS_GERMAN_PROVINCES_IN_NORTH_GERMANY: "All provinces in the §YNorth German region§! that are part of the §YGermanic§! culture group (except §YSwiss§!, §YAustrian§!, §YDutch§! and §YFlemish§!) are owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§!"
