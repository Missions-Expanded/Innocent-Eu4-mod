 sar_porto_torres_title: "Porto Torres"
 sar_porto_torres_desc: "The threat of the Lombards led Turris to set up heavy defenses and to host military contingents. After the interruption of contacts with Constantinople during the 9th and 10th centuries, the four Sardinian judges were formed, including the Giudicato of Torres-Logudoro, with Torres own initial capital. Torres was still the second largest center on the island politically, religiously and by demographic size. Around 1065 on the initiative of Judge Comita the Basilica of San Gavino was built, a cathedral until 1441. Already in this period the city of Torres, like all the seaside resorts of the island, began its decline due to malaria and constant pirate raids that began to afflict the coastal cities, leading the population to retreat inland, taking refuge in places such as the nearby village of Sassari, which in this period began its rise to become the major center of the north-west by gradually ousting the ancient Turrian city. In the final stages of the Giudicato it was Sassari that became the capital (even before that there was Ardara, always chosen for the same reasons). The Giudicato ceased to exist in 1259 with Adelasia di Torres. After the dissolution of the Giudicato di Torres the city was absorbed by the free municipality of Sassari. This institution was short-lived because with the arrival of the fleet of Alfonso IV of Aragon, the free municipality of Sassari undertook to become a vassal state of the nascent Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica commanded by the Aragonese. This subordination became official on July 4, 1323, giving way to the long Aragonese domination that shaped the city."
 sar_baleares_title: "Baleares"
 sar_baleares_desc: "Vital islands for the control of the Western Mediterranean sea the islands have been contended between the Muslims, the Byzantine, the Genoese, Pisans and now in the steady hand of the Spanyards, despite our best efforts for a diplomatic resolution, it seems like war is now at our doors, so be it, the pine of those islands will suffice the creation of an useful naval base."
 sar_berber_problem_title: "Berber Problem"
 sar_berber_problem_desc: "The corsair and pirate raids against Sardinia began in the eighth century. The first documented attack dates back to 705, a period of Byzantine domination, in which there were two raids by the Arabs to which the Byzantine garrison, small in number and rather improvised, could not in any way oppose. In addition to sowing terror among the defenseless and unprepared population, the raid yielded a substantial booty in goods but also in human lives, in fact dozens of men and women were kidnapped to be reduced to slaves. During the next fifty years the attacks followed with increasing intensity: the construction of the first towers and castles along the coast of Sardinia dates back to this period. \nLater also the Sardinian Giudicati, of Torres, Cagliari, Gallura and Arborea - the forms of government of Sardinia from the eighth to the fifteenth century - and then the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa, built numerous coastal fortifications of first defense which, at beginning of the Spanish domination, they amounted to about sixty."
 sar_strongholds_piracy_title: "Strongholds of Piracy"
 sar_strongholds_piracy_desc: "In 1159 Abd al-Mu'min, the founder of the Almohad dynasty, conquered Tunis, bringing a new government to the region. For Tunis it was a period of further development, which led it to become the first provincial capital, and capital of the kingdom in 1228, when the governor Abu Zakariyya took power and established the hafside dynasty. The conquest by the Almohads dates back to 1159 and the conquest by the hafside ruler Abu Zakarya Yahya in 1235. In 1302 the islet in front, called Penon, was occupied by the Castilians who made it the base for trade between the Kingdom of Tlemcen and the Iberian Peninsula. \nAnd now they are ours, the fall of the most important strongholds of the Berberic pirates has helped restoring peace in the Mediterranean sea a new age of Prosperity will finally arise alongside peace through these turbulent waters. Purification will mend the sins of those who inhabited the heathen cities."
 sar_tyrrenean_domination_title: "Tyrrenean Domination"
 sar_tyrrenean_domination_desc: "Extending from our City to the Island of Sicily the Tyrrhenian Sea is our most vital outlet for trade, and although our fleets reigns supreme over anyone that dared question our rightful ruling, new foreign powers, such as the Spanyards, have tried reaching out their fingers to dip them into the reaches of this trade, we shall show them clearly who's fleet is superior."

 sar_old_bonds_title: "Old Bonds"
 sar_old_bonds_desc: "The aid brought to Sardinia against the Arabs by the fleets of Genoa and Pisa, especially after the failed attempt to conquer the island in 1015-16 by Mujahid al-Amiri of Denia (the Mugetto or Musetto of the Italian Christian chronicles ), lord of the Balearics after the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate of al-Andalus - resulted in a growing influence of the two Maritime Republics in island politics. \nAt the turn of the thirteenth century only the Giudicato kingdom of Arborea had maintained its independence and sovereignty while following wars, marriages and political upheavals most of the territories of the Giudicato of Calari and the Giudicato of Gallura ended up being incorporated into the possessions of the Republic of Pisa; the Giudicato of Torres instead ended, especially after the battle of Meloria, under the influence of the Republic of Genoa and the Genoese families of the Doria and Malaspina."
 sar_naval_preparation_title: "Naval Preparation"
 sar_naval_preparation_desc: "The continuos raids of the berberic nations as well as the dream of the dominion of the Tyrrenean sea, as a starting point for our dominion of the Western Mediterranean, have clearly shown the dire need of a modern and efficient navy with ships that could set sail through the impervious whirls of the Sicilian Canal, defying the perils of the pirates' galleys."
 sar_sicily_title: "Sicily"
 sar_sicily_desc: "The island is an extraordinary sedimentation of beauty. A mixture of peoples and cultures. An uninterrupted, millennial take and give. A mutual enrichment of winners and losers. Take Palermo, a city where the concept of crisis, in a philosophical key, that is, a perpetual motion of changes makes us understand the meaning of history. The alternative to the condition of crisis is immobility, therefore nothing. There is probably no city in the world that offers this contamination of cultures, from classical Greek to Romanesque, from Arabic to Norman. And so much more."
 sar_malta_title: "Malta"
 sar_malta_desc: "The island fell in 870 under the rule of the Arabs, who eliminated almost all the original inhabitants and repopulated the archipelago, building the new capital Mdina on the site of the previous Roman city of Melita. The new rulers introduced the cultivation of cedar and cotton, built an irrigation system and, in particular, the Arabic language, which most of the population adopted as their mother tongue. Its influence in modern Maltese is easily found, as well as the presence of words of Latin origin and of the Latin alphabet. The Arab domination lasted for about two centuries, from 870 to 1091, during which Islam became the main religion on the island (although Christians were allowed to practice their worship). \nThe period of Arab domination ended in 1091 when the island was conquered by the Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily, at the helm of Ruggero d'Altavilla. The archipelago thus entered the Sicilian orbit, and was placed under the control of the members of the Norman house of Sicily, although in fact it was a little more than nominal control. In 1191 Margarito of Brindisi landed again on the island and was appointed first count of Malta. "

 sar_internal_stability_title: "Internal Stability"
 sar_internal_stability_desc: "The long war between Aragon and Arborea (1353-1420) and the plagues that followed one another since the mid-fourteenth century (starting with the terrible Black Plague of 1347) had devastated the socio-economic fabric of Sardinia. To this we must add that the commercial and manufacturing activities, which flourished especially in the once Pisan cities of Villa di Chiesa (Iglesias) and Castel di Calari (Cagliari), the agricultural prosperity of Oristano and the Campidani and the whole system of economic relations with the externals (eg with Genoa) were subjected to the feudal regime and to the interests of the crown, modifying some fundamental structures of Sardinian society, both from an economic and cultural point of view."
 sar_isbarcare_nord_otzidentale_title: "Sbarcàre Nord Otzidentale"
 sar_isbarcare_nord_otzidentale_desc: "Liguria, as everyone knows, is the smallest of the Italian regions. It starts from Tuscany, touches Emilia, borders Piedmont and is interrupted by the French border. But the Ligurian character is sharper than the variety of the regions that weigh on such a narrow strip of land would suggest. The greatest diversity can be seen passing from Genoa to the westernmost area. Here in the closed Liguria, laconic, commercial, reserved with foreigners, lacking in fantasy, the air of Provence is blowing."
 sar_conchistu_piemonte_title: "Conchìstu Piemonte"
 sar_conchistu_piemonte_desc: "The fragrant lands of the famous Moscato lies in front of us, towering from the heights of the Alps, ruled by foreigners who declare themselves Italian while being influenced from foreign courts and advisors. The perfect union may not start before we merge the mountains and islands."
 sar_dual_cities_title: "The Dual Cities"
 sar_dual_cities_desc: "A political and administrative union between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the mainland states owned by the Savoy, including Piedmont, the Duchy of Savoy, Nice, the former imperial fiefs of the Ligurian Apennines (which included the Novese and the Ovadese) and the former Republic of Genoa with the island of Capraia is a necessity now more than ever to be able to face the super powers that await us beyond the Alps."
 sar_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 sar_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 #4th column
 sar_gain_independence_title: "Gain Independence"
 sar_gain_independence_desc: "The Sardinian history has been characterized at all times by what he defined as the 'Sardinian constant resistance', that is the millennial struggle conducted by the islanders against the new invaders: in the periods in which they were influenced by the major colonial powers. According to the well-known archaeologist, the Sardinian fabric and the ancient traditions have been preserved through the centuries by the people of Barbagia who have handed them down to the present day."
 sar_maestro_ozieri_title: "Maestro di Ozieri"
 sar_maestro_ozieri_desc: "Although Spain was then forever out of the history of Sardinia, the long contact of the Sardinians with the Catalan-Aragonese and then Spanish culture left lasting traces. For many decades and at least until the age of the Restoration it was difficult for the Savoy rulers to eradicate deeply rooted customs and cultural forms, especially among the aristocratic class, but also in the rural population. In the Sardinian languages, the Iberian lexical imprints are still evident, as well as in the customs, in the great religious festivals and in many forms of socialization. In this sense, although the Spanish period is widely considered to be the darkest in the history of the island, it must be admitted that a conspicuous part of the Sardinian cultural heritage still today reveals deep bonds of affinity and sharing with that of the Iberian Peninsula."
 sar_tattari_title: "Tattari"
 sar_tattari_desc: "The origins of the current town of Sassari are to be found in the early Middle Ages, when the population of the coastal city of Turris Libisonis gradually took refuge inland, due to the raids of Saracen pirates. Around the 11th-12th century other villas were built in its surroundings, which later disappeared, such as Silki, Bosove, Enene and Kiterone. It is only in 1131 that the city is mentioned for the first time in reference to a certain Jordi de Sassaro, servant of Bosove, while in 1135 the church of San Nicola (Sancti Nicolai de Tathari) is mentioned. This information about the city comes from the Condaghe di San Pietro in Silki, a medieval code written in Logudorese and compiled from 1150 to 1180, but also containing more ancient documents dating back to the previous century. \nIt was the last capital of the Giudicato di Torres, and in 1294 it became a Free Municipality, confederate to Genoa (after an initial pro-Pisan period), following the promulgation of the Sassaresi Statutes. This corpus of laws, drawn up both in Latin and in Logudorese Sardinian, regulated the organization and functioning of the city: from urban planning, to economic activities, to justice. The Sassari statutes are one of the most important identity documents not only for the city of Sassari, but for the entire island."

 #5th column
 sar_judike_sardu_title: "Judike Sardu"
 sar_judike_sardu_desc: "With the decline of the Byzantine empire, starting from the IX century, the Sardinians gave themselves a new political order on the Byzantine organizational structure. The island was thus divided into four independent Giudicati both from the outside and from each other. The Giudicati were those of Torres-Logudoro, Calari, Gallura and Arborea and were ruled by a judge (judike or zuighe in Sardinian, judex in Latin), with the power of sovereign. They administered a territory, called logu, divided into curatoria made up of several villages, run by chiefs called majores. Part of the land exploitation, as well as agriculture, was managed collectively, a very modern organization for the time."
 sar_rennu_arbaree_title: "Rennu de Arbaree"
 sar_rennu_arbaree_desc: "It extended over the central part of Sardinia, from the Gulf of Oristano to the Gennargentu mountains, occupying the entire fertile valley of the Tirso river. Flat and mountainous at the same time, it bordered to the north with the Giudicato of Torres, to the east to a small extent with the Giudicato of Gallura, to the east and south with the Giudicato of Cagliari. It lasted for more than 500 years, from 900 to 1420. \nThe kingdom played a role of great importance in Sardinian history, distinguishing itself from the other judged contemporaries thanks above all to the last farsighted judges who constantly fought to reunite Sardinia under their flag. \nThe other three judges went through deep crises, suffering the interference of the maritime powers of Pisa, Genoa: it was the Arborea, allied to the kingdom of Aragon of which the judge declared himself a vassal, to determine their end and at the same time the Pisan influences in the 'island. Subsequently, it gave life to a bloody war against the kingdom of Sardinia, created by the papacy in 1297 and given to James II of Aragon, with the aim of putting an end to the struggles between Angevins and Aragonese in Sicily. \nIn the Giudicati of Arborea and Cagliari the head of state was above all called judge, in Gallura and Torres also "king"."
 sar_rebuilding_economy_title: "Rebuilding an Economy"
 sar_rebuilding_economy_desc: "The situation worsened in the countryside where feudalism was also applied in the former territories of the Arborea. The inhabitants led a grim and painful life, subjected to the bullying and abuses of the local lords and their procurators (podatari), given that the owners lived in Iberian territory. The tributes were numerous and burdensome, the most important being the Focatico or Feu, paid collectively and shared by the community among the individual families. The Llaor followed, weighing on the sown and not on the harvest. The right of Paglia was paid in wheat and barley to keep the viceroy's horses. Tithes were paid to the Church to support the prelates, parish priests and vice parish priests. Livestock was also taxed with the Deghino or Sbarbagio. They paid 10% of the honey and wax and a percentage for the wine sold. To all were added the Roadia (free services for the lord and free transport to Cagliari of the taxes collected in kind), the Silvae, the Presènti, the Corvées. They paid for the Scolca (police service), for the Curia (court of first instance), for the maintenance of the prisons and for the postal means (transport of correspondence)."
