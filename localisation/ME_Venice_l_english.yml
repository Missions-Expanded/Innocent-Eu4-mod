 ven_spanish_shores_title: "Spanish Shores"
 ven_spanish_shores_desc: "On the western edges of the Mediterranean Sea lies the ports of Iberia. Their crown jewel, Barcelona, is of vital importance to our mercantile rivals, the Genoans, and thus we would do well to incorporate it into our growing duchy."
 ven_trading_east_title: "Trading in the East"
 ven_trading_east_desc: "Cyprus, a "small continent" of some 9,400 square kilometers, became the largest, and most profitable, possession of the Republic overseas. Venice did not colonize Cyprus as it did for Crete; consequently the Venetians settled on the island in a more or less permanent way were not many, and mostly resided in Nicosia, which at the end of the Venetian domination had almost 25,000 inhabitants at the time, the largest city in the Stato da Mar. Some Venetian families, however, such as the Corner della Ca 'Granda, the Contarini dal Zaffo or the Giustinian Earls of Carpasso, made large profits from their Cypriot estates. As for the local nobility, some families - such as the Negron, the Singlitico, the de Nores and the Podocataro - managed to take advantage of the century of peace offered by the Venetian domination to accumulate enormous fortunes, and some of them made a military career in the Venetian army of the Mainland, in Italy."
 ven_silk_port_title: "Silk Port"
 ven_silk_port_desc: "Throughout the Venetian period, the population of Cyprus experienced a constant increase; the vast crops of wheat and barley allowed a rather regular exportation to Venice and its other possessions, and on some occasions were even enough to save the metropolis from famine, the production of sugar was gradually replaced by that of cotton, which in the course of the sixteenth century became a substantial source of income for local landowners; urban crafts produced a great variety of goods, especially quality fabrics; the large salt marshes on the southern coast guaranteed the Republic constant income, and constituted an essential support for Venetian commercial navigation, through a system of subsidies to shipbuilding financed with lots of Cypriot salt. Located as it was in front of the Syrian coasts, Cyprus was a stopover and an emporium of primary importance for Levantine trade, indeed, from a certain moment on, the great Venetian ships no longer even bothered to get to the ports Syrians, preferring to drop anchor in safer Cypriot waters, where they unloaded and loaded their goods while smaller vessels took care of transport between Cyprus and the neighboring coasts. The Cypriots engaged in this activity therefore played an essential role in one of the most important sectors of Venetian economic life."
 ven_discover_india_routes_title: "Discover a Route to India"
 ven_discover_india_routes_desc: "Over the course of a long career, Mairano, like countless other traders, had a stake in many deals: for timber, slaves, textiles, wine, ships, grain, metals, and more. But for reasons of simple economic alchemy, spices were the marquee good. As they moved between the jungles of South and Southeast Asia, where they were harvested, to their final points of sale in Europe, the value of spices mounted exponentially. They were small, readily transferable, durable and immensely desirable. \nWe should ought to seek a route to the port of Calicut."
 ven_arsenal_title: "Arsenale Veneziano"
 ven_arsenal_desc: "As in the Arsenal of the Venetians\nBoils in winter the tenacious pitch\nTo smear their unsound vessels over again\nFor sail they cannot; and instead thereof\nOne makes his vessel new, and one recaulks\nThe ribs of that which many a voyage has made\nOne hammers at the prow, one at the stern\nThis one makes oars and that one cordage twists\nAnother mends the mainsail and the mizzen..."
 ven_grow_the_arsenal_title: "Grow the Arsenal"
 ven_grow_the_arsenal_desc: "While the Venetian arsenal is of great use, it is not enough to sustain the needs of the ever-growing serene republic. Additional arsenals are to be constructed in other important cities and naval bases. The world shall gaze at the maritime might of Venice!"
 ven_galley_title: "A Formidable Fleet"

With the growth of the Most Serene Republic and the ever-increasing protection from the brave venetian sailors, Venice, and, in extension, Mediterranean, is experiencing an unprecedented level of growth."
 
 #2nd column
 ven_mare_hadriaticum_title: "Mare Hadriaticum"
 ven_mare_hadriaticum_desc: "The colonies in Dalmatia and Albania were united by the same structural feature, constituted as they were, in most cases, by an urban center and the territory dependent on it, which in some cases included smaller urban centers with their respective territories, and even some islands. Zadar, seat of a Latin archbishopric, was considered the metropolis of Dalmatia. Despite the gloom of the picture often painted by the descriptions of the Venetian rectors, Istria, Dalmatia and the possessions on the Albanian coasts were still able to supply Venice and the other territories with considerable quantities of agricultural products and raw materials, such as wine, salt, salted meat and fish, leathers from the Balkan hinterland, timber and building materials, such as the famous Istrian stone used for the construction of many Venetian palaces. And they also had manufacturing centers: at the Recanati fairs large quantities of "rasse", "sarze" and "grisi" - lower quality fabrics produced in Dalmatia and Istria are sold."
 ven_adriatic_coastline_title: "The Adriatic Coastline"
 ven_adriatic_coastline_desc: "During the fourteenth century, Venetian policy in the Adriatic area was guided by the same considerations that had already inspired it for some centuries. First of all, it was a question of maintaining the freedom and safety of navigation of their vessels in that sea, then of preventing any state or prince from attempting to settle on both sides of the Adriatic. Above all, however, it was a question of guaranteeing the predominance of the Serenissima in Dalmatia, a key region for all Venetian navigation in and out of what the lagoon city considered to be its own Gulf. The main factor on which the entire economic life of the Republic depended was in fact maritime trade, at a time when the mainland was still largely foreign to it, if not hostile. By maintaining its dominion in Dalmatia, Venice was at the same time satisfying three essential requirements of its politics. Also for this reason this vital connection and the set of problems that arose in this period in the Dalmatian area cannot fail to be at the center of our attention, especially since through their analysis the profile of the Venetian attitude towards all the Adriatic areas."
 ven_spice_trade_investments_title: "Spice Trade Investments"
 ven_spice_trade_investments_desc: "In the year 1173 a bankrupt Venetian merchant by the name of Romano Mairano went looking for a way out of financial ruin. Over a trading career spanning several decades, Mairano had seen his share of ups and downs, latterly, more downs than ups. He decided to orchestrate a risky trade that could help him pay off his loans and restore his wealth, a trade for one of the most valuable commodities of the day: spices."
 ven_arsenal_innovations_title: "Galilean Innovations"
 ven_arsenal_innovations_desc: "In 1593, Galileo Galilei began an advisor as regards the Arsenal. Thanks to his guidance, the Arsenal could improve its logistics and production. As a result of this, he would go on to publish a book inspired by the Arsenal."

 ven_milan_desc: "It is time to unite the Lombardo-Venetian people of Northeastern Italy. We shall unite with the Milanese and the house of Visconti, be it by diplomacy, or by most gruesome war."
 
 #3rd column
 ven_armada_title: "Armada"
 ven_armada_desc: "The Venetian navy took the name of Armata (in Venetian: Armada), which was also the name assigned to the individual naval teams and divisions, with a meaning equivalent to that of the fleet. \nFormally, command of the army was always a right and a prerogative of the Doge, which remained intact until the end of the Republic. However, although there is no shortage of cases in which principles even far in the years have taken the position of head of naval operations, the Republic foresaw that at the top of the navy, in case of war, a commander-in-chief would be appointed with the degree of: Captain general da mar, commander in chief of naval operations and admiral of the main core of the fleet. \nGalleys were generally divided between free, where the convicts were made up of free men recruited in cash, and forced, when the convicts were instead real convicts sentenced to oars. In times of war the ranks were further thickened by resorting to the zontaroli, condemned from all the territories of the Republic."
 ven_a_rival_port_title: "A Rival Port"
 ven_a_rival_port_desc: "The centuries-old contrasts between Veneto and Genoa found new nourishment during the fourteenth and fifteen century. During the anti-Turkish wars Genoa had once again fortified its bases in Chios, Focea, Pera; in the civil war in progress in the Byzantine Empire it had sided with the emperor John V Paleologus against the other emperor John VI Cantacuzeno - as a result, the island of Lesbos came into the possession of the Genoese family of Gattilusio. In the Black Sea, Genoa tried to control the commercial activities that took place in that area, proposing the transfer of the Venetian colony from Tana to Caffa, possession of the Ligurian city. To the Venetian refusal, Genoa forbade the merchants of the rival city to sail in the Black Sea. Again, the organization by Venice of a direct muda in Flanders, in Bruges and then in England, to export oriental goods and the products of its dominates, in particular Cretan wine, and buying local products there, especially English wool, thereby threatening Genoese interests in the Atlantic and the North Sea, increased the reasons for contrast."
 ven_crimean_goods_title: "Crimean Goods"
 ven_crimean_goods_desc: "Dyes, indispensable for the textile industry, appear little in the cargoes of ships returning from the East. One of the most expensive, the cochineal, is loaded by the Genoese on the ships returning from Pera and the Black Sea and by the Venetians on the galleys of Romània, Negroponte and Modone, since this does not offer us much information on the geographical origin of this product. From the same areas also come the greater loads of wax and leather, Danubian and Crimean exports constantly reported in the correspondence and in the letters of load of the Datini archive."
 ven_stato_da_mar_title: "Stato da Mar"
 ven_stato_da_mar_desc: "Defense was a source of continuous concerns, more and more serious as the Ottoman Empire, starting from the mid-fifteenth century, was gaining in power and hunger for territorial acquisitions. The priority assigned to the defense of the State from Mar stands out clearly from the continuous return to the topic in the dispatches and reports of the rectors and in the deliberations of the councils in Venice, as well as from the appointment of higher-ranking magistrates with positions relating to the military aspects of Venetian rule in the colonies most important, to be placed alongside the civil administration. \nFrom Alexandria to Valencia, none dares challenge our Merchants. Our Republic has beaten the odds and has emerged victorious on all fronts. Glory to us! Long live our Republic!"
 ven_dominate_spice_trade_title: "Dominate the Spice Trade"
 ven_dominate_spice_trade_desc: "With the discovery of alternate routes to India, our influence in Europe has declined. However, if we were to once again take control of the spice trade..."
 ven_republican_army_title: "A Republican Army"
 ven_republican_army_desc: "Until the beginning of the 15th century the Venetian power had been exclusively maritime, so that the entire military organization of the state had been centered on the fleet and on the military corps connected to it: Arsenalotti, Schiavoni and Fanti da Mar. then to add the cavalry corps provided by the maritime domains: Stradioti, Cimarioti and Sfaxioti. It was only the conquest of the mainland domains, which developed rapidly at the beginning of the century, that generated the need for the Venetian state to acquire a land army. The solution was the massive recourse to mercenary companies, which guaranteed a lower weight on public finances, linked only to the war periods, and a certain reliability, if compared with the lack of experience of Venice in the campaign war."
 ven_stato_terra_title: "Stato di Terra"
 ven_stato_terra_desc: "Ugnoło albergo ai nostri dì de łibartà, de justisia, de paxe, ugnoło receto dei boni e soło porto al cual, sbatue par ogni 'ndo da ła tiranìa e da ła guera, łe pol catar salvesa łe nave dei omeni che i serca de far na vida serena: Sità rica de or ma pì de nominansa, potente de forse ma pì de virtù, fondà sora forti marmari ma sora pì forti baxe de sivił concordia ferma e imovił e, mejo che dal mar dal cual ła xe senta, da ła prudente sapiensa de i so fioi difexa e fata segura.\nenglish: As the only city in the present day of freedom, justice, peace, the only refuge of the good and the only port to which, thrown everywhere by tyranny and war, the ships of men who seek to lead the life. A city rich in gold but more in name, powerful in strength but more in virtue, on solid marble founded but on more solid foundations of a firm and immobile civil harmony and, better than from the sea where it is surrounded, by the prudent wisdom of his children armed and made safe"

 ven_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 ven_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 #4th column
 ven_protect_venetokratia_title: "Protege Venetokratia"
 ven_protect_venetokratia_desc: "Constantinople and the Black Sea always occupied a prominent place in the commercial system of Venice and Negroponte was the nodal point of routing of maritime traffic in the Aegean. The island was also rich in agricultural products and exported grain, silk and wax. In the sixties of the fifteenth century Venice reserved a special convoy of market galleys for trade with Negroponte. The Aegean islands, such as Aegina, Tino, Schiato and Scopelo, constituted a sort of Far East of the Venetian state. The distance from the metropolis, and the fact that they were generally administered by young and less experienced patricians, sometimes transformed them into brazen hunting grounds for magistrates who looked to the two-year office on a remote island as an opportunity to line their pockets. It was not easy to control such distant estates, considered among other things of secondary importance, and it is likely that at times the results were deplorable. Pirate raids represented an endemic problem for the small islands, so much so that some were almost entirely abandoned by the inhabitants."
 ven_consolidate_colonies_title: "Consolidate Our Colonies"
 ven_consolidate_colonies_desc: "During the first phase, Venice was able to exploit in its favor the Ottoman advance in the region between the Aegean and the Adriatic, and the chronic conditions of insecurity on the Adriatic coasts, due to the activity of the crowns of Hungary and Naples and to the pressure exerted by the Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian and Albanian principalities of the interior. Some of the aforementioned acquisitions, including Scutari, Dulcigno, Antivari and Budua in 1405, were due to military intervention (5), but the spontaneous dedications were not few. The prospect of joining a Muslim Empire and the collapse of numerous buffer states in the Balkans led many cities, communities and lords to seek the protection of the winged lion. In several cases the Venetian takeover of a given territory followed the extinction of a local dynasty, or the advent of a weak or minor heir, or a dispute over the succession. Sometimes the advent of the Venetian domination was due to the concomitance of an uncertain or disputed dynastic succession with the Turkish threat. In 1388, for example, Maria d'Enghien, widow of Piero Corner, gave up in favor of the Republic the lordship of Argo and Nauplia. In 1423 Thessaloniki, threatened by the Ottoman conquest, offered itself to the Venetian lordship."

 ven_develop_venetia_desc: "It is true that all eyes are set on the peaceful city of Venice. And while that is most proper, eyes should also gaze at the gulf it resides in, for the Most Serene Republic controls these terrains as well. We shall make these regions grow and all eyes shall be blinded by the light that shines from the Gulf."

For the Venetian merchant courageous or lucky enough, Alexandria was the gateway to riches."
 ven_red_shores_title: "The Red Shores"
 ven_red_shores_desc: "The Red Sea was favoured for Roman trade with India starting with the reign of Augustus, when the Roman Empire gained control over the Mediterranean, Egypt, and the northern Red Sea. The route had been used by previous states but grew in the volume of traffic under the Romans. From Indian ports goods from China were introduced to the Roman world. Contact between Rome and China depended on the Red Sea, but the route was broken by the Aksumite Empire around the 3rd century AD."

 ME_Venice_Events.3.T: "Customs Houses in Dorsoduro"
 ME_Venice_Events.3.D: "Venice's connection to salt trade had existed since the primordial days of the pre-Roman city. However, the Venetian salt monopoly became an instrument in the Republic's commercial domination of the Mediterranean since the late 13th Century, when the Ordo Salis, or 'Salt Rule' was enacted. It required all ships returning to Venice to load their ballast with salt. Following this, the Magistrato al Sal was established to handle the customs of salt imports. It did not take long for 'White Gold' to become an important sector of the Venetian economy, as the Republic expanded her overseas territories specifically to capture salt producing locations, as well as constructing her own. All this salt of course had to stored somewhere. Special warehouses known as 'Saloni' were constructed in Dorsoduro, in the district now known as Punta della Dogana. These stores bolstered the economy even further, providing traders with accessible stores of liquid commodities."

 ven_the_colony_system_title: "The Colony System"
 ven_the_colony_system_desc: "The Renaissance was probably the last period in the long history of the Republic in which the Stato da mar played a leading role in the Venetian economy. The contribution of the colonies to the international maritime trade of Venice, and through it to the huge customs revenues of the Republic, was still considerable. The geographical arrangement of the maritime state, along the routes to the eastern Mediterranean, clearly demonstrates the very close link between the policy of colonial exploitation and maritime trade. From Venice to the southern Adriatic they mainly sailed by tacking, and even beyond the Adriatic ships spent more time in Venetian ports than on the high seas. \nThe Stato de Mar, called in the Venetian language Stato da Mar, consisted of the overseas territories conquered by the Republic of Venice. The regiments of the Dominions of the Sea were headed by the Provveditore Generale da Mar who lived on the island of Corfu. During their expansion, the Venetians formed a series of domains throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, ranging from Istria to Dalmatia, including Albania and the Ionian islands. Further east, the Republic conquered a large part of Greece, in particular the Cyclades, the Peloponnese and the Negroponte, as well as the large islands of Crete and Cyprus. In addition to the territories directly dominated by the Serenissima, the Stato da Mar also included several feudal lordships governed by the major noble families of the time. These lordships corresponded to the various Aegean islands, but were also established in Athens and Gallipoli."
