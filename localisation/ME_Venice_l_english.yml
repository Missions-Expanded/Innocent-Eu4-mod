 ME_Venice_Events.1.OPT1: "Glory to San Marco!"

 ME_Venice_Events.2.T: "A Steady Timber Supply"
 ME_Venice_Events.2.D: "Acquisition of our own domestic supply of quality timber will allow us to build vessels without having to rely on foreign sources. As such, the capacity of the Arsenal to supply our navy can be expanded greatly.\n\nIn addition to the obvious applications, our new supply of wood can also be used as wooden piles, meant for expanding Venezia and erecting new structures."
 ME_Venice_Events.2.OPT1: "Excellent"

 ME_Venice_Events.3.T: "The Porta Magna"
 ME_Venice_Events.3.D: "The Arsenal has been a key Venetian institution since its construction in 1104; since then, it has seen the Republic through many battles by providing the state with tens of thousands of warships through the centuries. To commemorate its very existence, we have decided to build a great gate at the entrance. This grand monument is inspired old Roman structures and marks a new era for the art and architecture in Venice and all of Italy."
 ME_Venice_Events.3.OPT1: "It is wondrous."

 ME_Venice_Events.4.T: "Establishing the Scuola degli Albanesi"
 ME_Venice_Events.4.D: "Good relations with the Kingdom of Albania have encourage Albanians to immigrate to Venice in moderate numbers. Those who have stayed and made their way have created a cultural center, the Scuola degli Albanesi, as a show of solidarity and security amongst the settling Albanians. They have currently established their headquarters in the Church of San Maruizio."
 ME_Venice_Events.4.OPT1: "You have to respect that tenacity"
 ME_Venice_Events.4.OPT2: "Commemorate them"

 ME_Venice_Events.5.T: "The Goods of Cyprus"
 ME_Venice_Events.5.D: "The formal annexation of the island of Cyprus has been a long time coming, with the various intertwining deals involving the Lusignan dynasty and the Republic. The territory has always been an excellent source of salt and grains to feed the homeland, but an debate has begun amongst the upper echelon of the Venetian bureaucracy on whether our efforts are better spent cultivating the fields or harvesting the salt pans. The Senate wishes to further our grip on the salt monopoly, while the Council of Ten wishes the focus on wheat exports to properly prepare for future shortages and famines."
 ME_Venice_Events.5.OPT1: "We need to keep that monopoly going!"
 ME_Venice_Events.5.OPT2: "Follow the Council. What good is money if you can't eat?"

 ME_Venice_Events.7.T: "Customs Houses in Dorsoduro"
 ME_Venice_Events.7.D: "Venice's connection to salt trade had existed since the primordial days of the pre-Roman city. However, the Venetian salt monopoly became an instrument in the Republic's commercial domination of the Mediterranean since the late 13th Century, when the Ordo Salis, or 'Salt Rule' was enacted. It required all ships returning to Venice to load their ballast with salt. Following this, the Magistrato al Sal was established to handle the customs of salt imports. It did not take long for 'White Gold' to become an important sector of the Venetian economy, as the Republic expanded her overseas territories specifically to capture salt producing locations, as well as constructing her own. All this salt of course had to stored somewhere. Special warehouses known as 'Saloni' were constructed in Dorsoduro, in the district now known as Punta della Dogana. These stores bolstered the economy even further, providing traders with accessible stores of liquid commodities."

 ME_Venice_Events.8.T: "Supervising Grain Production"
 ME_Venice_Events.8.D: "Wheat, barley, rye, millets, and oats are key to the survival of Venezia. The city is built in the middle of a lagoon, and while this provides it with obvious strategic advantages, it comes with its share of disadvantages as well. This was realized in the following the War of Chioggia, when the Republic began to expand to the Mainland, securing ample agricultural plots."
 ME_Venice_Events.8.OPT1: "Andémo béver un'ombra!"

 ME_Venice_Events.9.T: "Trade Treaty with the Mamluks"
 ME_Venice_Events.9.D: "Venice and the Mamluk Sultanate have been lucrative trading partners going back as far as the early thirteenth century. It has had a rough time as of late, as tensions over the spice trade have started to boil to the surface. However, a skilled ambassador may be able to normalize our relations, or better."
 ME_Venice_Events.9.OPT1: "Instruct him to pursue an alliance, we can't afford to lose the lucrative spice trade."

This would harken back to the height of our Republic, but that time is now."
