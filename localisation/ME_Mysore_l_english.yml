 #Mysore Missions
 tamil_re_indianization_desc: "Long ago, Indian culture made its way toward South East Asia through merchants and warfare. Hinduism and Buddhism, both Indian at their heart, spread forth through the islands and tropical lands, and to go along with this, Indian culture imparted various ways of organizing royalty in society and also the writing systems of various people groups. Since the Tamils are the foremost holders of Tamil culture and other Indian cultures, we could be in a position to bring a sort of second age of Indianzation, albeit with a bit more force behind it."
 mysore_renovate_srirangapatna_fort_title: "Srirangapatna Fortress"
 mysore_renovate_srirangapatna_fort_desc: "It is by no means a small fortress, but it is one that could do with some fixing up. If Mysore is to be protected from attacks in the future from places like the City of Victory and from Kerala, renovating and improving the Srirangapatna Fortress is an absolute must."
 mysore_first_alliances_title: "Extend a Friendly Hand"
 mysore_first_alliances_desc: "The situation is rather dire for Mysore as it stands. The Vijayanagara Empire, mighty as it is, seeks out hegemony over the Deccan and South India so that it may continue its glorious rise to prominence. Mysore is directly in that path, however, and so are many other states that line the coast and inland parts of the Deccan. It would be beneficial for us to reach out to these states and form a mutually beneficial alliance so that the Vijayanagara Empire is not able to projects its power so easily."
 mysore_our_home_area_title: "Restore our Heart"
 mysore_our_home_area_desc: "The central part of Mysore is in it of itself divided. What we traditionally know as the 'area of Mysore' is divided between the Vijayangara Empire and well, us, meaning that our current state is just a mere faction of its whole self. This cannot stand and we cannot remain separated like this; we must prepare ourselves and strike with our allies toward the Vijayanagara Empire before they become too powerful."
 mysore_kongu_memories_title: "Follow the Kaveri River"
 mysore_kongu_memories_desc: "Southward, toward the jungles of Kerala and toward the well known city of Madurai, Mysore's influence is somewhat known. Whilst we do not directly control this region, the area directly to our south known as Kongu is somewhat loyal to us whilst still being part of the Vijayangara Empire mostly. If we can manage to win a war against the mighty Hindu empire and secure Kongu as a whole, our pathway to being a South Indian power will be all the more clear."
 mysore_instability_of_the_ummatur_title: "Come Burning Down"
 mysore_instability_of_the_ummatur_desc: "Instability, lacking legitimacy, and struggling to keep up with internal politics... It is all weighing Mysore down to the point of being extremely vulnerable to outside forces. The fires are slowly rising, eating away at the foundations of our state and causing internal havoc throughout the land. We are either going to be entering a new age of turmoil to see a field of glory on the other side, or we are going to ride this instability out until its very end."
 mysore_access_to_the_coast_title: "Kolathiri, or Samoothiri?"
 mysore_access_to_the_coast_desc: "The splendid and wealthy states along India's southwest coast, the coast of Kerala, are fierce in their fights to maintain independence from various outside influences, but what they have in fighting ability they lack in unity across the wealthy coastline. Our two closest neighbors, the Kolathiri Dynasty of Kolathunadu and the Samoothiri of Calicut, are viable options for subjugation and expansion, but if we leave them in any sort of autonomous power, they will surely seek outside aid against us. Let us be swift and tactical with our annexation and cultivation of our initial access to the coast."
 mysore_end_vijayangars_heart_title: "Supersede the Sangamas"
 mysore_end_vijayangars_heart_desc: "For far too long, the Vijayanagara Empire and its Sangama Dynasty has ruled over a majority of South India. The power of the once grand dynasty is now fading, withering away bit by bit and succumbing to rising powers like us. Let us seize the venerable city that is at their heart, the City of Victory, and proclaim ourselves as the new authority for all of Southern India."
 mysore_firearms_for_mysoreans_title: "Questions of Black Powder"
 mysore_firearms_for_mysoreans_desc: "Mysore has is going to need to adapt to the coming times of warfare, that is true no matter what, but how Mysore becomes acquainted with and used to firearms both big and small is something that needs to be discussed in full. Advocates on one said espouse letting any Mysorean above a certain age access to these weapons, whereas advocates on another side advocate for only the military being allowed access to these weapons of war. Which side should we strive for here?"
 mysore_start_of_kannada_patronage_title: "A Mind for Literature"
 mysore_start_of_kannada_patronage_desc: "Kannada literature has been patronized at length and with great amounts of funding in the past. Grand writers of both Hindu and Jain adherence helped put together the Classical Period of Kannada Literature together prior to the 14th century, but with the Vijayanagara Empire in decline, who will take the place as the foremost patron and promoter of Kannada literary culture? Why, it will be none other than Mysore of course! And we will start with the Brahmins of our land, promoting the work they do in both the administration and in scholarly sectors."
 mysore_start_manufacturing_title: "Manufacturing Time"
 mysore_start_manufacturing_desc: "With a firm grip on valuable land in the Kerala area and with sufficient funding coming in from trade and taxes, Mysore is slowly aligning itself toward a position of economic reform. It will be slow and tedious as the infrastructure in our main cities is somewhat lacking, but by taking in advice from our financiers and engineers, we can plan out how our cities will expand with new buildings and eventually chart out how our economy will grow into the near future."
 mysore_filled_and_loyal_court_title: "A Mind for Politics"
 mysore_filled_and_loyal_court_desc: "The political game inside of Mysore is not always easy to navigate, any top official whether they are religious, military, or administrative in their orientation can tell you this with certainty. Regardless of the consistent internal shifting pieces we must deal with, we need to consistently work toward a more stable and successful functioning state through securing ties with local leaders and procuring good and loyal advisors. We should not be too hasty in our quest to do this though, as rushing things might bring more instability than we can handle."
 mysore_south_indian_domination_title: "The Fate of the South"
 mysore_south_indian_domination_desc: "With our push into the heart of Kongu now met with success and our military prepared to take on more daunting threats, we should turn our attention to the lucrative and important cities near the subcontinent's southern edge, before branching off into Lanka. Places like Madurai, Venad, and Tanjore are hubs of Tamil power and subsequentely resistance to Mysorean authority. We will need to conquer these strongholds one by one to ensure our southern front is never in danger, and to also secure ourselves lucrative new trade opportunities."
 mysore_iron_cased_rockets_title: "Rocket Regiments"
 mysore_iron_cased_rockets_desc: "The adaptation of muskets and cannons into Mysorean ranks is allowing our forces to compete with other states on a more equal playing field. New developments in rocket technology have been streaming into Mysore's military ranks and some are thinking they may just be the thing that can give our armies a distinctive edge in battle. If we can organize our regiments and effectively integrate them with rockets as a regular weapon of choice, we'll be ready to take on any military force in the world."
 mysore_fortified_from_invasion_title: "Stalwart Defenses"
 mysore_fortified_from_invasion_desc: "The fortifications in Mysore are great in some instances, the Srirangapatna Fortress being one them, but in other instances we are sorely lacking in defensive structures. The more of them we can build, whether they're situated on the coast or placed inland, the better off Mysore will be in terms of both military potential and defensive posturing."
 mysore_fight_off_european_influence_title: "Intruders from Afar"
 mysore_fight_off_european_influence_desc: "Slowly they come through, from the west toward the east in search of spices and land for themselves. Europeans are becoming more corageous and bold in their endeavors to take control of lands they deem valuable. South India is one of the places where they are seeking to gain a foothold so we must strive to defend it to the greatest possible degree."
 mysore_inroads_to_the_deccan_title: "Take Aim to our North"
 mysore_inroads_to_the_deccan_desc: "It seems we are finally make a name for ourselves, huh? Mysore is blossoming into a beautiful power the likes of which few in the past could ever achieve, but we are not done yet! To our north, in the Deccan, there are petty nawabs and rajas that seek to hold out against Mysore's rise to prominence. We need to show them that a new age is upon the subcontinent and that age is dominated by Mysore; we will demonstrate this be seizing the heart of the once famed and powerful Sultanate of Bahmanis."
 mysore_fortify_the_krishna_title: "The Wall of Krishna"
 mysore_fortify_the_krishna_desc: "Though the Krishna River provides a great amount of irrigation across the heart of the Deccan, we are wary of how it has been a marker of where invaders have crossed over to South India, and where others have also been stopped at in the past. Mysore's heartland in the south has the Srirangapatna Fortress protecting its north, but beyond that, fortifications are sparse across the landscape. Perhaps if we of Mysore make a chain of fortifications along the banks of the Krishna River and fortify it effectively, we can have it (the river) act like a hard stopping point for invaders before they ever reach southward toward Mysore itself."
 mysore_reformed_silk_production_title: "Textile Reformation"
 mysore_reformed_silk_production_desc: "The agrarian ways of Mysore are slowly being disrupted by the advent of trade from around the world. Demands are shifting, new ideas are coming to Mysorean lands, and the way we have done agriculture and the production of various goods is becoming outdated. To keep up with both the increasing demands of friendly trade partners and to bolster our own economy alongside others in the world, we should focus on developing proper places of dedicated to the production of certain resources and goods with new and innovative methods."
 mysore_education_and_theatrics_title: "A Mind for Mysore"
 mysore_education_and_theatrics_desc: "To think of Mysore in a simplistic manner of just being an administrative sector, a military sector, a diplomatic sector, and a peasant class would get you nowhere. Mysore, much like every other state around us, is a complex web of connections all working together to uphold the grandeur that is our functioning state. As time goes on, we are encountering new and bold ideas that challenge our traditions and we can't just stave them off; traders and diplomats alike bring them when they travel to our lands. Instead, we should begin to work with these ideas and attempt to integrate them into our culture and wider society through education and other means."
 WALL_OF_KRISHNA: "§GFortifications along the Krishna River will have excellent communication and coordination abilities, allowing for an effective defensive barrier between the Mysorean heartland in the south and the rest of the subcontinent.§"
 mysore_subjugate_marathi_people_title: "Mysore vs Maharashtra"
 mysore_subjugate_marathi_people_desc: "The Marathi people have a rich legacy of empires and kingdoms from the past like other cultures that are found throughout the subcontinent. They are hard to tame and often can help make or break the power of various leaders across the Deccan, but we of Mysore are different. We will learn from those who failed to subjugate the Marathi people in the past and take a more skillful and measured approach to integration. That is, after we firmly invade and annex the lands the Marathi call home: that which is known as Maharashtra."
 mysore_deccan_domination_title: "More than Mahisha Mandala"
 mysore_deccan_domination_desc: "Kannada culture stretches back centuries and its various kingdoms and empires all left a distinct mark on Kannada culture through lifting and lowering various dynasties, evolving the language itself, helping contribute to the scholarly works written throughout the centuries, and even how Hinduism, Islam, and Jainism is practiced. Even Mysore itself was called Mahisha Mandala in ancient times, referring to a mythological demon named Mahishasura, yet we are much more than those myths ever told of. What these various political entites that perpetuated Kannad culture in the past failed to do, however, is secure their continued existence thanks to a number of factors. Mysore will not be like those past polities, no, it will be in essence a culmination of those past efforts into one exalted and noble empire that likes of which the subcontinent has yet to see. We are and truly will be finest empire yet that expresses Kannada culture in its most pristine form."
 mysore_monopolize_trade_title: "Monopolisitic Maneuvers"
 mysore_monopolize_trade_desc: "With how much we are investing into production and infrastructure in the bustling coastal and inland cities of Mysore, it should come as no surprise that we are raking in a lot of money through trade and production. We are actually in a position to completely dominate whole trade sectors across the subcontinent, we just simply need to push ourselves a little bit harder. Annexing a few more pieces of land and building some more manufacturing centers will surely bring total trade hegemony to Mysore in the coming years."

 #Mysore Events#
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.a: "Troubles of Mysore"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.b: "Whilst we have done what we can to ensure stability and prosperity in Mysore, we have recently come upon hard times and our administration is struggling under the weight of various matters pressing down on it. Our ruler has not been the greatest in dealing with internal politics and our military is looking shaky at best in the eyes of the various castes in Mysore. Many high ranking officials and advisors of both Hinduism and Islam are putting the blame on the Ummatur Dynasty, suggesting that they have failed Mysore as a whole and deserve to be ousted, but would this truly be a wise move? A significant faction is also suggesting that there is a certain rot in the Mysorean administration and that those not loyal to the Ummatur Dynasty need to be expunged at once. Is there really a good choice here?"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.c: "We can never forsake the Ummatur Dynasty!"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.d: "It is time to end the decadence of the Ummatur Dynasty!"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.e: "In these desperate times, perhaps the Muslims can guide us."
 
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.a: "Questions about New Weapons"
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.b: "For a long time now, we have been getting progressively introduced to gunpowder weapons through both trade and through warfare. Gone are the ways of fighting with only a sword and shield with cavalry wings going forth, for we are seeing gunpowder weapons both large and small take the place of skilled swordsmen and heavily armored cavalry. The question coming up is now becoming more and more unavoidable to all of Mysore's administration: Do we attempt to distribute firearms more freely to Mysorean people? Or do we keep it strictly to the military?"
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.c: "If they can load it and fire, they can have one."
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.d: "Quality over quantity is what we stand by."
