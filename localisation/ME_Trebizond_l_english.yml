 TRE_georgian_diplomacy_title: "Georgian Diplomacy"
 TRE_georgian_diplomacy_desc: "The Georgian nation has long been a supporter of the Komnenos dynasty. They helped us to establish Trebizond as a powerbase during the tumultous civil wars and disasterous 4th Crusade. We must strengthen these bonds if we want to survive."
 TRE_look_to_the_west_title: "Look to the West"
 TRE_look_to_the_west_desc: "The Italians have long dominated the seas around Anatolia and have been looking for more ports in order to bring more trade from the Orient. We can mutually benefit from the importing of ideas from the west and the export of goods from the east."
 TRE_italian_banking_innovations_title: "Import Italian Banking"
 TRE_italian_banking_innovations_desc: "The Italians have perfected the art of banking, supplying much of the monarchs throughout Europe with money to fund their campaigns. By importing these innovations in money lending, we can also ensure a steady stream of money to fund our conquests."

 TRE_bring_theodoro_back_to_fold_title: "Theodoro's Allegiance"
 TRE_bring_theodoro_back_to_fold_desc: "Theodoro was once a loyal vassal to the Trebizond despotate. The years have drawn our nations apart and the ever present threat of the Saracen has distracted us from our brothers across the sea, but the ties run deep. Theodoro may be willing to accept vassalization in exchange for monitary benefits."
 TRE_black_sea_ports_title: "Black Sea Ports"
 TRE_black_sea_ports_desc: "The Black Sea has been a crossroads of trade for many generations. The Ottoman Empire threantens to turn the Black Sea into a personal lake. We must gain control of the trade in the region to ensure we can keep our fair share of the goods crossing the sea."
 TRE_proposition_for_genoa_title: "Proposition for Genoa"
 TRE_proposition_for_genoa_desc: "Genoa has controlled many of the Crimean port cities for many years; with the crumbling of the Byzantines, Genoa is having increasing trouble holding these far flung territories from the Turks and Tartars. Perhaps they would be willing to part with the territories in exchange for some money."
 TRE_phoenix_in_the_east_title: "Phoenix in the East"
 TRE_phoenix_in_the_east_desc: "Civil war and strife have dominated the Greek world for the centuries following the disruption of the 4th Crusade. With the ever-looming threat of a Turkish invasion, we cannot allow the petty squabbles of the past to divide us any longer.  If we wish to rise from the crumbling dust, we must unite our people."
 TRE_production_in_the_pontic_mountains_title: "Production in the Pontic"
 TRE_production_in_the_pontic_mountains_desc: "Long ago, Trebizond and the Pontic Mountains were important producers and traders of silk, silver, and copper. If we wish to restore our once mighty empire, we must invest in the production of our homeland."
 TRE_religious_reforms_title: "Religious Reforms"

 TRE_ecumenical_patriarch_title: "Ecumenical Patriarch"
 TRE_ecumenical_patriarch_desc: "The Patriarch of Constantinople has been the head of the Orthodox Church and a source of authority for the Roman Emperors since the 5th Century. By bringing the Patriarch under our thumb, we can promote our religious hegemony over the region."
 TRE_pontic_army_title: "Pontic Army"
 TRE_pontic_army_desc: "The years have not been kind to our national army. Long periods of internal strife have led to the decay of our national army.

 TRE_war_with_turks_title: "War with the Turks"
 TRE_war_with_turks_desc: "The time has finally come. Trebizond has historically avoided outright war with the various Turkish states in Anatolia, but the Ottomans now threaten hegemony over the entire region. We must strike now if we have any hope of survival in the coming years."
 TRE_reunite_pontic_coast_title: "Reunite the Pontic Coast"
 TRE_reunite_pontic_coast_desc: "While Trebizond controls much of the Pontic coast, major port cities like Sinop lie outside of our current borders. Control over the whole region will allow us greater flexibility in defense and allow us to strike at the heart of Anatolia."
 TRE_across_the_mountains_title: "Across the Mountains"
 TRE_across_the_mountains_desc: "While the Pontic Mountains act as an excellent strategic barrier for the defense of Trebizond proper, the time has come to strike at the heart of Anatolia in order to reclaim the region for ourselves."
 TRE_claim_the_interior_title: "Claim the Interior"
 TRE_claim_the_interior_desc: "The interior of Anatolia was removed from the Greco-Christian world following the outfall of the Battle of Manzikert.

We must regain these lands if we wish to restore the greatness we once held. "
 TRE_control_cilicia_title: "Control Cicilia"
 TRE_control_cilicia_desc: "The Cicillian Plains of southern Anatolia were once one of the most productive farmlands within Anatolia.

 TRE_ponts_in_hiding_title: "Ponts in Hiding"
 TRE_ponts_in_hiding_desc: "Despite the years of Turkish rule, Ponts and Crypto-Greeks still represent much of the population of the Pontus. If we can encourage them to return to their roots, management of the area will be significantly eased."
 TRE_cappadocian_greeks_title: "Cappadocian Greeks"
 TRE_cappadocian_greeks_desc: "The Cappadocian Greeks are the remnants of the greek population that lived in central Anatolia before the arrival of the Turks. Between the rugged terrain and the underground network of cities and fortresses, they have managed to avoid conversion and elimination by the force of both the invading Turkish armies and Timur's deadly campaigns.

 TRE_aegean_coast_title: "The Aegean Coast"
 TRE_aegean_coast_desc: "The many divets and sheltered harbors of the Aegean coast of Anatolia have, since antiquity, been home to many ports and cities. Control over this area is vital to ensure our continual growth as a rivived power, espeically on the high seas."
 TRE_our_aegean_sea_title: "Our Aegean Sea"
 TRE_our_aegean_sea_desc: "The Aegean Sea has been at the center of the Greek world for millennia, both acting as a conduit of trade and a barrier from invasion. When the Italians took many of the scattered islands and coastal cities in 1204, they struck at the core of the Byzatine world. We must restore these islands to our rule to ensure our protection from piracy and naval threats."
 TRE_komnenoi_restoration_title: "The Komnenoi Restoration"
 TRE_komnenoi_restoration_desc: "The Komnenos Dynasty led the Byzantine Empire through the first of the Crusades and recovered much of Anatolia from the Turkish menace.

 TRE_bulgarian_expansion_title: "Bulgarian Expansion"
 TRE_bulgarian_expansion_desc: "The Bulgarians sit on a very important defensive position for the Greek world. They control the mountainous barrier between Thrace proper and the northern Steppes and Danubian Plain. Holding this region is paraamount to the security of Constantinople and Greece."
 TRE_return_prosperity_to_greece_title: "Let Greece Prosper"
 TRE_return_prosperity_to_greece_desc: "The Greek homelands have been covered in the blood of our kin and enemies for too long. Between the Latins, Bulgarians, Slavs, and Turks, Greece has not been at peace for more than 200 years.

 TRE_advance_our_Frontier_title: "Advance our Frontier"

 TRE_into_armenia_title: "Into Armenia"
 TRE_into_armenia_desc: "Armenia was historically one of the first states to convert to Christianity; now they stuggle to face waves of muslim invaders. Despite not holding to the same branch of Christianity as us, we can still lighten their burden."
 TRE_open_the_straits_title: "Open the Straits"
 TRE_open_the_straits_desc: "When the Ottoman Turks crossed into Europe for the first time, they gained control over the Hellespont and thus control over the Black Sea trade.

 TRE_rise_from_the_ashes_title: "Rise from the Ashes"
 TRE_rise_from_the_ashes_desc: "We are now a mere stone's throw away from reclaiming Constantinople.

It is time to restore the Komnenos to the throne of the Roman Empire."
 TRE_reclaim_greece_title: "Reclaim Greece"
 TRE_reclaim_greece_desc: "With control over the Imperial capital, the natural expansion route now lies at the rest of the Greek homelands. It is finally time to reunite the Greek homelands under our rule."
