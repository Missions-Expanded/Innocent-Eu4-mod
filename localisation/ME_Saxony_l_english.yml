 saxony_leipziger_reichsmesse_title: "Leipziger Reichsmesse"
 saxony_leipziger_reichsmesse_desc: "It is a privilege and an honor to be in a position to hold an Imperial Reichsmesse, a privilege given out to a select few cities to hold the markets of the Holy Roman Empire. Leipzig sits at a suitable crossroads to offer significant competition to nearby cities. Let's start trading!"
 saxony_leipziger_buchmesse_title: "Leipziger Buchmesse"
 saxony_leipziger_buchmesse_desc: "Though a farming province in and of itself, Leipzig attracts commerce far and wide to conduct business within its mighty markets. A rare collection of bookstores have emerged in the area, presenting a unique opportunity for the construction of a new book market."
 saxony_integrate_poland_title: "Integrate Poland"
 saxony_integrate_poland_desc: "The time has come. With our skilled manipulation of the nobility within Poland, playing them off against each other, inflaming conflicts and supplying backdoor deals and equipment to nobles believed to weak to intervene in the situation. At last the Polish nobility is depleted. The few remaining lynchpins within the country are all staunchly devoted to the idea of becoming powerful nobles within a much greater nation, and the remainder are too weak to oppose them. Now is finally the time to cease the existance of Poland as an subordinate nation to our own, and instead let the Province of Poland come to exist the great nation of Saxony."
 saxony_imperial_religious_conflict_title: "Religious Conflict"
 saxony_imperial_religious_conflict_desc: "There is no denying it, the Holy Roman Empire is in chaos. Religious tensions grow as the Pope's authority shrinks, and it is in our hands now to decide the course of action ahead."
 saxony_church_above_crown_title: "Church Above Crown"
 saxony_church_above_crown_desc: "Caeseropapism is dead, for the Pope reigns supreme across Great Saxony's domain! We will stand tall as the backbone of Catholicism, giving way for the church to exert its authority and rid these lands of heresy."
 saxony_oppose_the_reformation_title: "Oppose the Reformation"
 saxony_oppose_the_reformation_desc: "The Holy See's will is final, and though the Reformation blazes like a flame across Europe, it cannot smolder brighter than Rome's righteous fury 'crosst these wretched infidels."
 saxony_the_catholic_league_title: "The Catholic League"
 saxony_the_catholic_league_desc: "Catholicism needs a banner to stand behind, and though we do not stand at the center of the Holy See, we will do our part to defend it. Let us raise arms in the name of the Lord to crush the opposition once and for all!"
 saxony_prosper_leipzig_title: "A Prosperous [62.GetName]"
 saxony_prosper_leipzig_desc: "One of the main economic centers of Saxony, Leizpig is home to a large portion both a our rural production and urban commerce. Even the Emperor has taken notice of the great mercantile potential of the city, opening new opportunities for the future."
 saxony_the_university_of_leipzig_title: "The University of [62.GetName]"
 saxony_the_university_of_leipzig_desc: "The rapid expansion of [62.GetName] has given rise to a growing population of intellectuals and upperclassmen willing to take the leap and receive higher education. Though it will take time, an insitute to foster this genious would surely benefit the entire nation."
 saxony_leipziger_handelsboerse_title: "Leipziger Handelsbörse"
 saxony_leipziger_handelsboerse_desc: "With merchants reigning supreme in the city of [62.GetName], we should establish a center of conduct for the mercantile class to ensure cooperation in addition to the natural competition that commerce provides."
 saxony_reconquest_of_the_lausitz_title: "Reconquest of the Lausitz"
 saxony_reconquest_of_the_lausitz_desc: "We have not forgotten the great betrayal by the Habsburgs in 1076, granting the territory of Lusatia to the Duke of Brandenburg instead of us, its rightful owner. The fiends then sold the territory to Bohemia, thereby creating the unlawful crownland of Lusatia under administration from Prague. This disservice to the Saxon peoples shan't go unpunished, for retribution will soon come."
 saxony_construct_the_finstertor_title: "Construct the Finstertor"
 saxony_construct_the_finstertor_desc: "The contested territory of Lusatia needs to be defended from potetial reconquests by the Bohemian or Polish crowns. We shall erect a Dark Gate, making use of the province's natural terrain to prove useful in deterring invasion."
 saxony_the_saxon_polish_union_title: "The Saxon Polish Union"
 saxony_the_saxon_polish_union_desc: "The Elective Monarchy of Poland is a marvellous concept. It allows the potential for the best possible ruler to rule the nation, while also securing foreign alliances. However it has one major failling. It has no legislative protection from the whims of the nobles that form the electors. As a rising power on their borders, many of the Polish Nobles holding lands along our border have subtley approached us to discuss matters of protection. With these votes, and a few more we may gain from diplomacy and bribes within the nation, it may be possible for us to turn the Polish Crown over to a member of our dynasty, and then, with the support of the border nobles, overturn the elective monarchy, leaving us the absolute rulers of Poland and Saxony."
 saxony_the_polish_prerogative_title: "The Polish Prerogative"
 saxony_the_polish_prerogative_desc: "Poland is now our subject, but their loyalty is yet to be won. The nobility on the borders with our direct holdings are all for the complete integration of Poland into our nation, subverted with promises of higher titles and the destruction or demotion of their rivals. Now is a time to allow the status quo to dvelop, and allow the opposing nobles to stabilise and acclimatise to their new positions, and perhaps, in time, they will realise that becoming part of Saxony, is a much better turn of events then they first realised."
 saxony_unite_the_thrones_title: "Unite the Thrones"
 saxony_unite_the_thrones_desc: "Though holding the title of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Poland, [Root.Monarch.GetName] exerts little authority over the vast newly-conquered lands. Though it will take time, we must work to integrate these territories into one throne: Saxony."
 saxony_secure_the_saxon_coasts_title: "Secure the Saxon Coasts"
 saxony_secure_the_saxon_coasts_desc: "The Scandinavians have long terrorized the coasts of the Empire, targeting Pomerania and Prussia indescriminantly. We would do well to construct fortifications to dissuade any future attempts at such horrible provications as these."
 saxony_crown_above_church_title: "Crown Above Church"
 saxony_crown_above_church_desc: "Our lands lie in the North of Germany, far from the Italian peninsula, and yet over such a great distance, we are still expected to petition the Pope for every matter of religious contention. Rome proclaims itself the final legal matter on all spiritual affairs, and yet their guidance never reaches as far as our lands. No longer. We shall turn away from Rome and it's uncaring leaders, and instead look to those who have shown time and again to believe in the good of the Saxon people, our rulers."
 saxony_embrace_the_reformation_title: "Embrace the Reformation"
 saxony_embrace_the_reformation_desc: "Luther speaks the truth. The Holy See seeks to exploit our fertile soil for monetary gain, all the while ensuring our obedience through the use of priests and clergymen, claiming that they alone comprehend the Word of God. This form of strongarming has gone on for far too long. It is time t hat we finally cast of the shackle of the Roman Church and establish our own, independent branch of Catholicism led by Saxons alone. To arms, brothers and sisters in fath!"
 saxony_union_of_auhausen_title: "Union of Auhausen"
 saxony_union_of_auhausen_desc: "The tensions within the empire are reaching their peak, armed conflict across Germany is looking more and more innevitable. If the people of the reformation are to survive the coming storm, they must have a strong leader. There is no better nation to take on this position, and ensure the right of the reformed faiths to exist, than our own."
 saxony_victory_in_the_league_war_title: "Victory in the League War"
 saxony_victory_in_the_league_war_desc: "The storm has hit. The thunder is the sound of cannons, firing across the continent, toppling walls and tearing down fortifications. The rain is the hail of bullets and arrows, filling the air with shrieks and watering the ground with enough blood to water the plants for decades. The Wind is the cries and lamentations of the women and children left without their menfolk, to fend to themselves while their worlds burn to the ground. And dark clouds loom ever on the horizon, the threat of infidels and heathens from beyond the continent, all waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike, and shatter Europe irreparably. This war must end. And it is our duty to our people to ensure it is in our victory."
 saxony_develop_wittenberg_title: "Develop [59.GetName]"
 saxony_develop_wittenberg_desc: "A core of the heartland of Saxony, [59.GetName] is an integral source of tax income. Though underdeveloped, the province has great potential for industrial and agricultural expansion."
 saxony_the_university_of_wittenberg_title: "The University of [59.GetName]"
 saxony_the_university_of_wittenberg_desc: "A nation's aptitude may be defined in the knowledge it produces for the betterment of mankind. With advances in every field growing more common, we would do well to create an environment that fosters intellect and allows those talented few to shine."
 saxony_saxon_coinage_title: "Saxon Coinage"
 saxony_saxon_coinage_desc: "A large supply of Europe's formal coins emerge in the Saxon mints of Dresden, home to considerable deposits of silver that allow us to produce valuable currency to exchange with our mercantile brothers. Through careful investment and regulation, we could utilize this competitive advantage to boost our economy to new levels of productivity and sustainability."
 saxony_saxon_thuringian_relations_title: "Thuringian Saxon Relations"
 saxony_saxon_thuringian_relations_desc: "The tumultuous succession of Frederick IV has officially been settled, but unofficially remains contested by Frederick II's younger brother, Willian III. We must solidify our hold over Thuringia, lest it fall into the hands of hostile kin."
 saxony_a_saxon_march_title: "A Saxon March"
 saxony_a_saxon_march_desc: "The Margraviate of Brandenburg belongs to our Saxon kin, though this means very little in the world of politics. They content both our claim to Lusatia as well as rival our influence in the Holy Roman Electorship. They cannot be allowed such autonomy as to limit our own."
 saxony_a_saxon_coast_title: "A Saxon Coast"
 saxony_a_saxon_coast_desc: "Despite our grand ambitions, little have we dreamed of the great waves before us. Yet the Baltic shores call to Saxony, encouraging conquest as the Danes abuse their naval superiority. The raids will end by fire and blood."
 saxony_eastward_expansion_title: "Eastward Expansion"
 saxony_eastward_expansion_desc: "The Baltic region of Europe was one of the last holdouts of Paganism in all of Europe. For centuries the people of the region withstood conversion and any attempts to take over the reason by force, and for the longest time, the rest of the christian world were forced to admit the Balkan people, as an unpleasent blemish on Christian Europe, but one that could be ignored. In the end, it was the Teutonic Knights who finally pacified the region, sweeping through Prussia and the rest of the Baltics ensuring the extermination or conversion of all who opposed them. As an ascendant power, from a newly arisen religion, it would be symbloic for us to reenact this grand crusade, and much like the knights, our first port of call shall be Prussia."
 saxony_a_saxon_naval_base_title: "A Saxon Naval Base"
 saxony_a_saxon_naval_base_desc: "In order to achieve Saxon naval superiority, we must first tend to coastal infrastructure. As it stands, Northern Germany lacks the structures to support an oceangoing navy capable of challenging the north. Smart and suitable investments in the region will assist in getting our fleet up and running for the whole world to see."
 saxony_conquer_hesse_title: "Subjugate Hesse"
 saxony_conquer_hesse_desc: "The Hesseians present a constant and apparent threat to the integrity of our borders. Boasting a powerful mercenary army, their propensity for militarism seemingly knows no bounds. Indeed, we should rein them in so that we might preserve ourselves in the wake of greater danger."
 saxony_conquer_lower_franconia_title: "Foothold in Bavaria"
 saxony_conquer_lower_franconia_desc: "Bavaria is a land who have treasured their independance and special responsibilities within the Empire. They are a powerful state within the Empire, who have always been able to keep pace with all the states around them, despite the more advantageous positions of those neighbouring rivals. It is a certainty that such adaptable people would find a great home within our fledgling German state, and that we have plenty of benefits that could come from them."
 saxony_the_road_to_germany_title: "The Road to Germany"
 saxony_the_road_to_germany_desc: "@GER §Y[GER.GetName]§! is on the Horizon. Our grand ambition is one of such scope that it seemed impossible to acheive from the first day, but our people pushed forwards regardless, perhaps naively, but with an optimism and drive that put to shame the entire world. Now we stand on the very precipice, only a single province remains outside our domain, and with it's acquisition we could legitimately identify ourselves as not Saxony, but Germany. Let the world know of the unity of the German people, let them hear the roar of a people who will no longer be divided, who will no longer allow foreign aggressors to turn them against each other and will instead stand taller than any other nation in the world."
 saxony_the_ninety_five_theses_title: "The Ninety Five Theses"
 saxony_the_ninety_five_theses_desc: "A preacher has come to some renown recently in [59.GetName]. He has over some time compiled a list of the misdeads of the Catholic church, and a thesis on what is fundamentally wrong with it's methodology. All of this he nailed to the door of the local church. Naturally the contents of these theses have rapidly been distributed throughout the local area and beyond. After a brief read, many of the major players within our country have confirmed the validity of their contents, and now push us to show support for this radical reformer. While open support may not yet be a wise decision, if we invest in the local area, and while doing so, perhaps implement a few of these changes in the way the area is run, we may be able to show our favour without incuring political opposition."
 saxony_the_reichserzmarschall_of_saxony_title: "The Reichs- Erzmarschall"
 saxony_the_reichserzmarschall_of_saxony_desc: "The Prince-Electorate of Saxony has the prestigious title of Arch-Marshal of the Empire. Though mostly ceremonial, this bears with it the responsibility of the defense of the Empire. We must closely align ourselves with the dynastic Emperors to ensure its proper security. If this is impossible, we must simply take the office for ourselves. In the name of security."
 saxony_a_throne_built_on_blood_title: "A Throne Built on Blood"
 saxony_a_throne_built_on_blood_desc: "The imperial seat is now ours. A [Root.Religion.GetName] emperor now reigns over all of Germany. But what was the cost? How many faithful died on the fields, so that we might sit atop this seat? How many people wil starve to death in the coming months because their are no men left to tend the fields, or because the fields themselves have been burned to the ground in the name of victory? It is our duty now to answer all of these questions, and provide a solution to each in turn. No embarrassment is too great, no humiliation not worth it so that our subjects might finally know peace, free from the persecution of the unenlightened. In my dreams, it is glorious. In my waking nightmares, everything is coated in blood."
 saxony_claim_east_frankish_heritage_title: "East Frankish Heritage"
 saxony_claim_east_frankish_heritage_desc: "Historically, the Duchy of Saxony was a core part of East Francia, a successor state of the Carolingian Empire. While this empire has long since dissolved, the idea of a united East Francia remains. This will provide us ample legitimacy to conduct expansionary policy in the Holy Roman Empire. All as Charlemagne intended, we're sure."
 saxony_invest_in_dresden_title: "Invest in [61.GetName]"
 saxony_invest_in_dresden_desc: "Despite being the seat of the Saxon crown, [61.GetName] remains stagnant in its development. It is the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s duty to ensure the continuous growth of the capital, and this we shall do well."
 saxony_saxon_mining_industry_title: "Saxon Mining Industry"
 saxony_saxon_mining_industry_desc: "Simply put, the foundation of the Saxon economy is our mining industry. We rest on the border of the Eastern Ore Mountains, rich in iron and silver though lacking in development. We should build up further mining facilities to ensure ample extraction of resources for the prosperity of Saxony."
 saxony_eisenkammer_pirna_title: "Eisenkammer Pirna"
 saxony_eisenkammer_pirna_desc: "Founded in 1472, the Iron Chamber was the institution designed to distribute extracted iron within the Pirna mining district, effectively establishing a monopoly on iron in the region. Such wealth shan't go unexploited, for we know a good opportunity when we see one."
 saxony_a_true_saxon_state_title: "A True Saxon State"
 saxony_a_true_saxon_state_desc: "While we hold the title of Saxony, and are therefore the nominal rulers of the Saxon people, the true saxon people occupy a vast swathe of German lands, much of which not just outside our own hands, but wthin the territories and fiefdoms of our sworn enemies. To be truly deserving of the title of Saxony, we must centralise the Saxon people under one nation. To precipitate this, we have created a grand plan. The first step, is to aquire the weak and defenseless lands of Anhalt to our north, while simultaneously striking eastwards into Bohemia. Too long have rightful god fearing Catholics laboured under the bootheels of those Hussite loving scum."
 saxony_renovation_of_the_st_sebastian_cathedral_title: "St. Sebastian Cathedral"
 saxony_renovation_of_the_st_sebastian_cathedral_desc: "Upon the crux of our conquests lies the city of Magdeburg, home to the holy St. Sebastian Cathedral. Under the Bishopric did the cathedral waste away, as was the case with the nation as a whole. We have put an end to this decay, and now it is our duty as rightful conquerors to renovate this great work of piety and architecture."
 saxony_construct_the_german_cathedral_title: "The German Cathedral"
 saxony_construct_the_german_cathedral_desc: "As one of the cultural centers of Germany, Berlin represents a homeland for many of the Empire seeking simple salvation. We shall provide a home for these many worshipers of the Lord, so that we might take one step closer to the divine, for it is our duty as Christians."
 saxony_westward_expansion_title: "Westward Expansion"
 saxony_westward_expansion_desc: "It is finally time. Our burning ambition has led us to unite every Saxon into our domain and now we sit upon the precipice of our ultimate goal. With but a few more battles, the Saxon people will finally be reunited for the first time since before the reign of Charlamagne oh so long ago."
 saxony_reunite_saxony_and_thuringia_title: "Unite Saxony and Thuringia"
 saxony_reunite_saxony_and_thuringia_desc: "Ever since the death of Frederick IV, Saxony and Thuringia have been united under one ruler, if not one banner. After all this time, the moment has come to incorporate the duchy as a formal crownland of Saxony."
 saxony_conquer_upper_franconia_title: "Conquer Franconia"
 saxony_conquer_upper_franconia_desc: "The Franconian people are a very small portion of the people of Germany. They remain under the reign of a very few leaders, and refuse the rule of anyone not of Franconian descent. If we are to create a united German state, as is our ultimate goal, then we need to reach a compromise with these people that would allow us to properly integrate these people into our nation without the use of overly forcible methods. A people whose freedom is taken will always rise against their rulers at every oppertunity. A People who offer up their independance willingly will be much more ready to find their own place within a larger system."
 saxony_saxon_humanism_title: "Saxon Humanism"
 saxony_saxon_humanism_desc: "Unlike many of our peers, Saxony recognizes the one fundamental truth of the world: we are all humans under God. Love thy neighbour regardless of his beliefs, and you will find yourself far more enlightened than the so-called Roman Inquisition would lead you to believe. Let us welcome one and all to our great nation!"
 saxony_a_grand_kursachsen_title: "A Grand Kursachsen"
 saxony_a_grand_kursachsen_desc: "There are very few positions within the Holy Roman Emperor more prestigious and powerful than that of an Elector. Granted to them is the supreme authority with which to crown the Emperor of the faithful, the leader of the Most Holy empire on the planet. If we were to secure such a position, then no door within the empire would be closed to us."
 saxony_a_kingdom_within_title: "A Kingdom Within"
 saxony_a_kingdom_within_desc: "The title of King within the Empire is one of extreme prestige and is an incredible show faith from the Emperor. Only the Emperor himself may grant unto a catholic state within the empire the right to call itself a Kingdom, and once granted such a title may never be revoked. If we were able to aquire such a title, then no one in the Empire would be able to question our legitimacy as a true soverign state."
 saxony_saxon_imperial_ambitions_title: "Saxon Imperial Ambitions"
 saxony_saxon_imperial_ambitions_desc: "Our country is a great one. A home to brilliant minds who deserve respect far beyond what is paid to them. We must acquire a greater level of prestige within the Holy Roman Empire. We must prove our selves a viable nominee to the title of Emperor, and in doing so hopefully aquire the resources needed to reward the deserving already existing in our state."
 saxony_meissener_porzellan_title: "Meißener Porzellan"
 saxony_meissener_porzellan_desc: "As Chinese porcelain floods the market, Europe's coffers grow increasingly bare, as the Asians stockpile our silver en masse. It is crucial that we develop our own alternative to these dishes made into art."
 saxony_dresdner_residenzschloss_title: "Dresdner Residenzschloss"
 saxony_dresdner_residenzschloss_desc: "Built over the course of several centuries, Dresden Castle remains the residence for the Royal Family of Saxony. Each century sees some expansion and improvement of the building. Now, it is our turn to do our share and create something truly magnificent."
 saxony_integrate_the_city_of_goslar_title: "Integrate the City of [4742.GetName]"
 saxony_integrate_the_city_of_goslar_desc: "A centerpiece of the Saxon world, Goslar is a weak and undefended city-state. Given our long and complicated history, it will come as no surprise when we march across their borders and bring about a new order of Saxon rule. Certainly the Emperor won't mind one less Free City... we hope."
 saxony_construct_the_royal_library_title: "Construct the Royal Library"
 saxony_construct_the_royal_library_desc: "The Saxons are a dispersed people, residing all across Germany in enclaves of foreign hodgepodge. Being so widespread, it is natural that some of the most brilliant minds of the century claim Saxon heritage. If we were to combine the culmination of this knowledge into one location, we are certain that it would springboard Saxony into a new era of technlological advancement."
 saxony_the_origin_of_knowledge_and_culture_title: "The Origin of Knowledge"
 saxony_the_origin_of_knowledge_and_culture_desc: "The Saxon people are at the forefront of innovation across Europe. Despite this, we have had difficulties transferring this knowledge out of isolated pockets and into the hands of the masses. No more. With the advent of the Printing Press, as well as significant investment into learning institutions, we can ensure the dispersion of knowledge into the minds of those that will use it well."
 saxony_the_weimar_classic_title: "The Weimar Classicism"
 saxony_the_weimar_classic_desc: "A literary and cultural movement, Weimar Classicism is the emerging branch of humanism, sparked by our openness to all that seek refuge from the chaos of war and inquisition. The natural evolution of Romanticism, Classicism, and the Enlightenment, this unique school of thought is worth fostering."
 saxony_the_enlightenment_ideals_title: "Enlightenment Ideals"
 saxony_the_enlightenment_ideals_desc: "As the Enlightenment sweeps across Europe, we find ourselves at the center of it all. Finally, our peers realize what we have been propagating from the start: we are all equal under God. As we were among the embers that sparked this movement, we shall waste no time in fully embracing it."
 saxony_literature_of_the_weimar_classic_title: "The Weimar Literature"
 saxony_literature_of_the_weimar_classic_desc: "With bookmarkets becoming increasingly popular, a new breed of writers and lyricists has emerged in Weimar and surrounding regions. Boasting significant influence over the population through nothing but words, we would be wise to recruit some of these men to court."
 saxony_obersaechsischer_reichskreis_title: "Reichskreis Obersachsen"
 saxony_obersaechsischer_reichskreis_desc: "The Upper Saxon Imperial Circle constitutes all Saxon lands we theoretically preside over, whether it be in spirit or name. More pragmatically, it means that we are the defenders of the Saxon peoples in this region. Despite this, there are those that would content this title. The Margraviate of Brandenburg grows more powerful by the day, and the West Saxons seem keen on usurping the position. Let us throw caution to the wind and embrace our role wholeheartedly so that no contender might challenge us!"

 sax_release_the_nordmark_title: "Release the Nordmark"
 sax_release_the_nordmark_desc: "It has been too long since the Northern March served its original purpose, the defense of Germanic peoples in the region. We have curtailed the influence of Brandenburg, and as such perhaps it is time to restore its predecessor under our rule."

 SAX_UNTIL_NOT_OUR_MARCH_ANYMORE: "for as long as @BRA §YBrandenburg§! is our §YMarch§!"

 # Events:
 ME_Saxony_Events.EVTNAME1: "The Leipziger Buchmesse"
 ME_Saxony_Events.EVTDESC1: "[62.GetName] has developed into a major market town, attracting craftsmen and traders from across the Holy Roman Empire. These immigrants bring with them considerable wealth and new trades: Recently, Konrad Kachelofen, one of Nürnberg's most prominent printers, relocated to the city and established a large printing press in it. This will surely lead to great future prosperity for the city - and higher tax receipts for us - in future."
 ME_Saxony_Events1.EVTOPT1: "[62.GetName] should play a role in the printing industry as well."
 ME_Saxony_Events1.EVTOPT2: "We should concentrate on the book market."

 ME_Saxony_Events.EVTNAME2: "The Mines of [4742.GetName]"
 ME_Saxony_Events.EVTDESC2: "In the wake of the annexation of [4742.GetName], we have acquired the rich mines of Rammelsberg, near the northern edge of the Harz mountain range. These mines represent a vital source of silver and copper for the use of the Saxon state, and should be exploited to the fullest. Saxon miners are already migrating to Goslar, seeking a small share in whatever fortune that awaits. Indeed, wealth lies ahead!"
 ME_Saxony_Events2.EVTOPT1: "The mines will be important for the coming centuries!"

 ME_Saxony_Events.EVTNAME3: "The Frankish Legacy"
 ME_Saxony_Events.EVTDESC3: "The mighty mantle of the Frankish Crown is not an easy one to claim. And despite this, a pretender to this claim has risen up, preaching that they are the successor to Francia, and more pertinently, the Empire of Charlemagne. This foolish act has greatly upset the status quo of the region, and we have been called to act."
 ME_Saxony_Events3.EVTOPT1: "They are pretenders and need to be put into their place."
 ME_Saxony_Events3.EVTOPT2: "We need to reunite the Frankish Realm again, but under our rule!"
 ME_Saxony_Events3.EVTOPT3: "Their claim is wrong and doesn't concern us."

 # Ideas:
 SAX_East_Francia_ideas: "East Frankish Ideas"
 SAX_East_Francia_ideas_start: "East Frankish Traditions"
 SAX_East_Francia_ideas_bonus: "East Frankish Ambition"
 SAX_East_Francia_utilize_german_and_latin: "The German-Latin Split"
 SAX_East_Francia_utilize_german_and_latin_desc: "One of the key splits in the past when the lands of West Francia, Middle Francia, and East Francia arose was that of language. In West Francia, the Franks continued to utilize Latin in more circumstances than we of East Francia did, thus setting both on a course of diverging paths. Though we cannot doubt the authority Latin has in holy matters, we must work to make peace between those who prefer to speak Latin regularly and those who wish to speak Germanic languages regularly. Getting cohesion between these two masses will help make our administration all the more efficient."
 SAX_East_Francia_ecclesiastic_holdings_controlled: "Lands of the Pious in East Francia"
 SAX_East_Francia_ecclesiastic_holdings_controlled_desc: "We hold the lands of a great many bishoprics and such, revoking their temporal authority and relegating these petty holy men back to theological debates and spiritual teachings. Yet we are not so hasty as to dissolve their holdings altogether since that would arouse the anger of not only the clergy, but also the peasantry and nobility of East Francia. We should instead take the time to work with these now somewhat landless clergy and ensure that we can form a strong relationship with them, for the good of all East Francia."
 SAX_East_Francia_stem_duchies_reined_in: "Address the Stem Duchies"
 SAX_East_Francia_stem_duchies_reined_in_desc: "Previously, as royal power weakened thanks to a variety of factors, the old stem duchies of Bavaria, Franconia, Lotharingia, Saxony, and Swabia began to distance themselves away from the seat of authority in East Francia. Now that we have a more robust royal cadre and administration though, those past mistakes won't be repeated in the slightest. We will take all the necessary steps to ensure that the stem duchies have no chance of straying away, and if some legal break is found in our legislation, we will put in proper provisions to retake that land in the name of the our most gracious leader. These regions must serve a singular authority figure, not themselves."
 SAX_East_Francia_saxons_over_franks: "Saxon Blood over Frankish Blood"
 SAX_East_Francia_saxons_over_franks_desc: "Favoring the Saxon people over the Frankish people was only inevitable when one sees the cultural makeup of the old West, Middle, and East Francia. If we continued to utilize Frankish nobility and royalty, the Germanic people from top to bottom would be an ever-present threat to our authority. Embracing the Germanics is perhaps the best option we could have done, and now more than ever are they willing to serve under our banners since we have regained so much lost power. It has not been easy to get where we are, but the glory of East Francia is being found once more."
 SAX_East_Francia_resolve_issues_of_local_appointed_nobles: "Local Nobles at Ease"
 SAX_East_Francia_resolve_issues_of_local_appointed_nobles_desc: "One part of the stem duchies moving away from central authority in the past was the appointment of local nobles to positions of power in said stem duchies. We need to ensure that people we want are in the posts most vital throughout the lands of East Francia, and we also need to strike a balance between loyalty and merit with those that we choose. Building up this process of selection over time will strengthen our ties to the people of the land and keep them at ease, no matter their wealth status."
 SAX_East_Francia_royal_power_is_the_sole_power: "Authority from the Top Down"
 SAX_East_Francia_royal_power_is_the_sole_power_desc: "As part of the efforts to ensure that central authority is respected throughout East Francia, we must constantly be aiming at having legislation and laws passed from the perspective authority being inherently going from the top down. In this way we can keep the less educated and less wealthy in East Francia in line with what we want; even meddling in the notion of authority coming from the bottom up is a recipe for East Francia collapsing in on itself."
 SAX_East_Francia_revisiting_the_treaty_of_verdun: "The Old Treaty, Revisited"
 SAX_East_Francia_revisiting_the_treaty_of_verdun_desc: "August of 843... That was the fateful moment in history when the fate of the old Carolingian Empire was forever sealed. Ever since then, the developing states of Frankish and Germanic people have caused a great deal of strife and these issues even resulted in the entirety of Middle Francia being dissolved in all respectable senses after the death of Lothair I. That treaty decided the fates of generations upon generations and though some in East Francia today wish they could redo parts of it, we must not let this mood prevail. Instead, we should revisit it and stake our claims where we can through it. The return of East Francia has renewed the old claims to titles and ranks in the west, and we shall take them by force if need be."
