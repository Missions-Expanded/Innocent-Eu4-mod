 # Events:
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.t: "Gustav Vasa of Sweden"
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.d: "Gustav I, born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family and later known as Gustav Vasa (12 May 1496 – 29 September 1560), was King of Sweden from 1523 until his death in 1560, previously self-recognised Protector of the Realm (Riksföreståndare) from 1521, during the ongoing Swedish War of Liberation against King Christian II of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Initially of low standing, Gustav rose to lead the rebel movement following the Stockholm Bloodbath, in which his father perished. Gustav's election as King on 6 June 1523 and his triumphant entry into Stockholm eleven days later meant the end of Medieval Sweden's elective monarchy and the Kalmar Union, and the birth of a hereditary monarchy under the House of Vasa and its successors, including the current House of Bernadotte."
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.a: "Yes, Let him rule our mighty nation."
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.b: "No, We are better without him."
 ME_Sweden_Events.2.t: "Gustavus Adolphus Magnus"
 ME_Sweden_Events.2.d: "Gustav II Adolf (9 December 1594 – 6 November 1632, O.S.), widely known in English by his Latinised name Gustavus Adolphus or as Gustav II Adolph, was the King of Sweden from 1611 to 1632 who is credited for the founding of Sweden as a great power (Swedish: Stormaktstiden). He led Sweden to military supremacy during the Thirty Years' War, helping to determine the political as well as the religious balance of power in Europe. He was formally and posthumously given the name Gustavus Adolphus the Great (Swedish: Gustav Adolf den store, Latin: Gustavus Adolphus Magnus) by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1634."
 ME_Sweden_Events.2.a: "Der Löwe aus Mitternacht is here!"
 ME_Sweden_Events.2.b: "He is not capable of anything."
 ME_Sweden_Events.3.t: "Charles X of Sweden"
 ME_Sweden_Events.3.d: "Charles X Gustav, also Carl Gustav (Swedish: Karl X Gustav; 8 November 1622 – 13 February 1660), was King of Sweden from 1654 until his death. He was the son of John Casimir, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken-Kleeburg and Catherine of Sweden. After his father's death he also succeeded him as Pfalzgraf. He was married to Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, who bore his son and successor, Charles XI. Charles X Gustav was the second Wittelsbach king of Sweden after the childless king Christopher of Bavaria (1441–1448) and he was the first king of the Swedish Caroline era, which had its peak during the end of the reign of his son, Charles XI. He led Sweden during the Second Northern War, enlarging the Swedish Empire. By his predecessor Christina, he was considered de facto Duke of Eyland (Öland) before ascending to the Swedish throne. His numbering as Charles X derives from a 16th-century invention. The Swedish king Charles IX (1604–1611) chose his numeral after studying a fictitious history of Sweden. This king was the fourth actual King Charles, but has never been called Charles IV."
 ME_Sweden_Events.3.a: "A true leader, worthy of Sweden."
 ME_Sweden_Events.3.b: "No more von Wittelsbach in Sweden."
 ME_Sweden_Events.4.t: "Charles XI of Sweden"
 ME_Sweden_Events.4.d: "Charles XI, also Carl (Swedish: Karl XI; 24 November 1655  – 5 April 1697 ), was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611–1718). Charles was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was five years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon after, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial and economic situation, managing to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This descendant was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf."
 ME_Sweden_Events.4.a: "He may not be a warrior king, but he is the future of the Swedish military."
 ME_Sweden_Events.4.b: "Another wannabe king of Sweden."
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.t: "Carolus Rex"
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.d: "Charles XII, also Carl (Swedish: Karl XII; 17 June 1682 – 30 November 1718 O.S.), Latinized to Carolus Rex, was the King of Sweden from 1697 to 1718. He belonged to the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, a branch line of the House of Wittelsbach. Charles was the only surviving son of Charles XI and Ulrika Eleonora the Elder. He assumed power, after a seven-month caretaker government, at the age of fifteen. In 1700, a triple alliance of Denmark–Norway, Saxony–Poland–Lithuania and Russia launched a threefold attack on the Swedish protectorate of Swedish Holstein-Gottorp and provinces of Livonia and Ingria, aiming to draw advantage as Sweden was unaligned and ruled by a young and inexperienced king, thus initiating the Great Northern War. Leading the Swedish army against the alliance Charles won multiple victories despite being usually significantly outnumbered. A major victory over a Russian army some three times the size in 1700 at the Battle of Narva compelled Peter the Great to sue for peace which Charles then rejected. By 1706 Charles, now 24 years old, had forced all of his foes into submission including, in that year, a decisively devastating victory by Swedish forces under general Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld over a combined army of Saxony and Russia at the Battle of Fraustadt. Russia was now the sole remaining hostile power. Charles' subsequent march on Moscow met with initial success as victory followed victory, the most significant of which was the Battle of Holowczyn where the smaller Swedish army routed a Russian army twice the size. The campaign ended with disaster when the Swedish army suffered heavy losses to a Russian force more than twice its size at Poltava. Charles had been incapacitated by a wound prior to the battle, rendering him unable to take command. The defeat was followed by the Surrender at Perevolochna. Charles spent the following years in exile in the Ottoman Empire before returning to lead an assault on Norway, trying to evict the Danish king from the war once more in order to aim all his forces at the Russians. Two campaigns met with frustration and ultimate failure, concluding with his death at the Siege of Fredriksten in 1718. At the time, most of the Swedish Empire was under foreign military occupation, though Sweden itself was still free. This situation was later formalized, albeit moderated in the subsequent Treaty of Nystad. The result was the end of the Swedish Empire, and also of its effectively organized absolute monarchy and war machine, commencing a parliamentarian government unique for continental Europe, which would last for half a century until royal autocracy was restored by Gustav III. Charles was an exceptionally skilled military leader and tactician as well as an able politician, credited with introducing important tax and legal reforms. As for his famous reluctance towards peace efforts, he is quoted by Voltaire as saying upon the outbreak of the war; "I have resolved never to start an unjust war but never to end a legitimate one except by defeating my enemies". With the war consuming more than half his life and nearly all his reign, he never married and fathered no children. He was succeeded by his sister Ulrika Eleonora, who in turn was coerced to hand over all substantial powers to the Riksdag of the Estates and opted to surrender the throne to her husband, who became King Frederick I of Sweden."
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.a: "He was truly chosen by heaven."
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.b: "This man will let his army freeze to death against the Russians and then fight them at an unwinnable battle."
 ME_Sweden_Events.6.t: "The Leadership of Carolus Rex"
 ME_Sweden_Events.6.d: "Charles XII was known for his great leadership. At the battle of Narva he managed to defeat an army 4 times his size. Whilst fighting Poland–Lithuania he managed to win a series of great battles. He had shown his leaders and soldiers how bravery can lead into great victories."
 ME_Sweden_Events.6.a: "We are men of attack. We shall carry that legacy."
 ME_Sweden_Events.6.b: "Patience in virtue for every leader."
 ME_Sweden_Events.7.t: "German Refugees"
 ME_Sweden_Events.7.d: "Germans from the Holy Roman Empire have been exiled away from their land, most of them seek refuge in Sweden."
 ME_Sweden_Events.7.a: "Their skills are of our interests."
 ME_Sweden_Events.7.b: "No, only Swedes are allowed in Sweden."
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.t: "Carolean Infantry"
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.d: "Caroleans (Swedish: karoliner) were the soldiers of the Swedish kings Charles XI and Charles XII whose notable tactics differed from that of Western Europe through a greater reliance upon pikes, rapiers, bayonets and the spirit of the offensive which lead them to winning most of their battles even when greatly outnumbered."
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.a: "This new tactic is well needed."
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.b: "The men are needed. The tactic, no."
