 ### MISSIONS ###
 swe_flames_of_freedom_title: "The Flames of Freedom"
 swe_flames_of_freedom_desc: "The authority of the crown wanes day by day and it is clear that we would be better off without any Danish influence inside our lands. The time has come to start mustering our forces and preparing for that which will surely come. Many rebels have come and gone, but it won't be long before the Riksföreståndare frees Sweden from Copenhagen's grasp"
 swe_freedom_war_title: "Befrielskriget"
 swe_freedom_war_desc: "The Kalmar Union, which was initially formed in order to stop the Germanic expansion northwards into Scandinavia, has failed it's task. The Hanseatic merchants run rampant in our markets and policies devised by Danish monarchs in order to combat these merchants have failed time and time again. The Engelbreckt rebellion's success must be imitated in order for Sweden to finally receive it's long awaited independence."
 swe_swedish_tiger_title: "En Svensk Tiger"
 swe_swedish_tiger_desc: "The Swedish tiger must be on the prowl, for it's neigbours seek to destroy it. Little do they know, the tiger's fangs are sharper up close."
 swe_inrikesaffar_title: "Inrikesaffar"
 swe_inrikesaffar_desc: "The future looks towards warfare, yet a focus on internal development cannot be ignored, especially given Sweden's tenuous economic base. Mining does sustain the coffers, but nothing matters if the peasant is hungry, and angry. While land tenure remains in its early stage, the Solskifte is a promising tradition that still remains only partially implemented. By expanding the tenure to the more frozen and mountainous regions, more farmers gain equal access to the sun, boosting productivity and growth that can be taxed. This requires an expansion of the bureacracy, which is most easily facilitated in the capital. All in all, the focus on the internal will prove to benefit the country."
 swe_northern_beauty_title: "Northern Beauty"
 swe_northern_beauty_desc: "Stockholm is envisioned by many as the center of Sweden itself, but it's small size relative to many European cities makes it appear pathetic. This is why Monarchs like Christina envisioned a stockholm to bring others to its knees, an Athens of the North and the powerhouse of Baltic trade."
 swe_open_wide_o_earth_title: "Open Wide, O Earth"
 swe_open_wide_o_earth_desc: "They didn't tell me, because I don't need to know. Do you need to know, or have you heard enough?"
 swe_royal_ironworks_title: "Kungliga Järnbruket"
 swe_royal_ironworks_desc: "Sweden's aging iron industry lags behind Europe in all but sheer quantity of produce. If Sweden wants to retain a competitive edge in the metal industry, we mus look elsewhere for expertise."
 swe_bothnian_trade_coersion_title: "Bottniska Handelstvånget"
 swe_bothnian_trade_coersion_desc: "The main policy surroundig internal trade revolved around the Gulf of Bothnia, constraining trade so that it only flowed through the gulf, and more specifically Stockholm. Recently the constraints have conflicted with our mercantilist model, which is why there have been plans to designate specific cities that gain free reign of external trade, and residing the rest to just internal trade."
 swe_tar_trade_title: "Control the Tar Trade"
 swe_tar_trade_desc: "Tar is one of many lucrative exports in the Baltic, and the numerous lakes that dot the Scandinavian countryside make easy shipping for the cheap produce. As a result, it is important that standardizes taxes are imposed on exports, as the constant state of warfare in Sweden makes revenue heavily desired."
 swe_innovative_manufacture_title: "Scientific Manufacture"
 swe_innovative_manufacture_desc: "Nothing is more optimistic than Stjärnsund"
 swe_skaneland_title: "Skanska Kriget"
 swe_skaneland_desc: "Skaneland sits very close to the Swedish heartland, and is even culturally similar to sweden, but most importantly it is owned by Denmark, which cannot be allowed. A Danish foothold on Scandinavia gives them too much opportunity to strike and reclaim Stockholm for themselves."
 swe_finnish_development_title: "Österlanden Utveckling"
 swe_finnish_development_desc: "As one of the few conquered territories considered to be a core province, Österland is also the most underdeveloped, being sparsely populated outside of the western coast, and thats due to close proximity to Stockholm. In order to sustain eastward advances, Our eastern territories must be brought up to shape."
 swe_cut_them_down_title: "Cut Them Down"
 swe_cut_them_down_desc: "Eastern Norrland and much of Österland is populated by Finns who have served in the Swedish army for centuries by this point. Finland also enjoys the status of being an integral part of the Kingdom, and thus must pull its weight in the same fashion as the rest of Sweden. Finnish tactics with cavalry have shown extreme adeptness in reconnaissance and hit-and-run tactics, charging while shouting "Hakkaa Päälle!", meaning "Cut them Down". These fierce warriors must be utilised by us."
 swe_great_northern_war_title: "Stora Norra Krigen"
 swe_great_northern_war_desc: "Sweden's storm grows wider, and the neighbouring powers know this too well. If Sweden is to survive the harsh winters that will come, we must be colder."
 swe_shock_and_awe_title: "Shock and Awe"
 swe_shock_and_awe_desc: "Gustavus Adolphus, a key reformer of armed forces in the 17th century, was crowned king of Sweden at age 17. His country was poor and sparsely populated, but already the ambitious young Lion of Midnight intended to enrich it with new lands and looted wealth. The only way to do that was by war, so he set out to reform the army. He soon proved to be a superb reformer and administrator within Sweden, and later emerged as an even more able strategist and general in Germany. Over his first decade as king, he transformed the army into a national force and built up the navy to protect his supply route to Poland and Germany. As Gustavus modernized the weapons, drill and fighting techniques of the Swedish army, he also professionalized it, by shifting recruitment away from a traditional levy of ill-trained peasants raised locally to create a national army of well-trained regulars secured for long-term service by conscription. He took the best Dutch innovations out of the waterlogged, compact and canalized environment of the Netherlands to maximize their revolutionary potential on the broad battle plains of Poland and Germany, where a war of maneuver was more likely to lead to field battles and more able to achieve success. Like Maurits and other Dutch reformers, he newly emphasized drill and infantry discipline, centered on learning volley and double-volley fire. In disposition for battle he deployed by brigades, freeing his troops from the old infantry blocks, reorganizing into flexible and more linear formations. Thinning was achieved at some defensive cost, as lines exposed flanks when moving in ways that a pike square of 50 × 50 or so ranks and files did not. The trade-off was worth it: all this cleared the way for Sweden’s ascent into the ranks of the Great Powers, to intervention in the Thirty Years’ War for Swedish gain and the Protestant cause."
 swe_allotted_for_war_title: "Allotted for War"
 swe_allotted_for_war_desc: "Sweden is low on many things, most importantly: men. As a result, the older subdivision would be strengthened. In order to obtain funds for this reform, among other things, an extensive reduction was carried out , which made significant land holdings available to the state. The fact that this was the basis for the reform made it easier to get the lower estates with them, and by contrasting it with contributions - extra taxes that also affected the lower part - it also received sufficient support at Riddarhuset. The infantry's crew was kept as a so-called constant hold of the common people by rotation : each province or county undertook to equip a regiment of 1,200 men in eight companies consisting of 150 men. Two or more farms, together at least two mantles , would together form a rote , and recruit and support a soldier; where the farms were smaller than a mantle, more farms were allowed to merge. The divided soldier would in most provinces have a home with an associated piece of land, so-called soldier's croft. If the land was not fertile enough to support itself on, the soldier would be compensated. He would also receive a salary. Due to all the benefits, there were many younger peasant sons (who would not succeed the father on the farm) during the constant bondage who preferred to be recruited as a soldier rather than become a farmhand . In peacetime, the peasants had a maximum of three months to fill vacancies, and otherwise a fine was imposed and one of the root holders was allowed to go out as a soldier."
 swe_sound_toll_dominance_title: "Öresundstullen Dominans"
 swe_sound_toll_dominance_desc: "The Danes have a chokehold on Baltic commerce, starving our cities and making any meaningful excursion into the Atlantic impossible. While they remain weakened by the collapse of Kalmar, we should strike and enforce our will over the Baltic, and maybe even look further west."
 swe_window_to_atlantic_title: "Window to the Atlantic"
 swe_window_to_atlantic_desc: "With the Sound secured, trade remains most lucrative outside of the Baltic. With the right funding, we could launch Sweden into India and the Americas and establish an incredibly wealthy trade empire. All we need now is the right launchpad."
 swe_looking_overseas_title: "Looking Overseas"
 swe_looking_overseas_desc: "The time has come to set foot outside of the Baltic, Sweden finally has secure access to the Atlantic and with it, its riches."
 swe_new_sweden_title: "Nye Sverige"
 swe_new_sweden_desc: "The short lived colony in Delaware had promise, as it retained trading rights and flourished with settlers. If we want to establish a stronghold in North America, we must ensure that the colony does not fall, or destroy all the competition."
 swe_overseas_empire_title: "Span the Seas"
 swe_overseas_empire_desc: "The Swedish flag is seen on every island, in every port and at every shore. No longer are we the Lion of the North, we are the Lion of the World, with it's paw casting a shadow over every empire."
 swe_norway_crown_title: "Norweigan Crown"
 swe_norway_crown_desc: "Despite the collapse of Kalmar, it has shown the nordic countries that unity is possible. Similar languages, cultures and history make the area ripe for uniting again. This time, however, Sweden will not be weak and subject to germanic influence, for it will lead the north from Stockholm!"
 swe_hanseatic_rivalry_title: "Hanseatic Rivalry"
 swe_hanseatic_rivalry_desc: "For centuries the trading cities of Germany have contested and destroyed Swedish commerce, establishing monopolies over the Baltic and beyond. We must seek indemnity for this unjust dominance by turning the waves against them."
 swe_river_tolls_title: "River Tolls and Tariffs"
 swe_river_tolls_desc: "Baltic trade remains lucrative, but the real riches come from the flow of water into the sea. The Elbe, Oder and Weser all serve as the arteries of the Holy Roman Empires, and by constricting the flow, we can squeeze even more money out of the dying empire."
 swe_secure_the_landings_title: "Secure the Landings"
 swe_secure_the_landings_desc: "If we ever want to establish a Dominum Marius Baltici, we must ensure easy access over our waters. This is why a professional marine regiment must be created."
 swe_gold_coast_title: "Goldkusten"
 swe_gold_coast_desc: "Following the foundation of the Swedish Africa Company  by Louis de Geer an expedition under the command of Hendrik Carloff was sent to Africa in 1650. Carloff made a treaty with the Akan King of Futu on selling some areas of land. On 22 April 1650 the Swedish Gold Coast was founded and Carloff became its first administrator. In 1652 the foundations were laid of the fort Carlsborg."
 swe_charter_india_title: "Charter the SOIC"
 swe_charter_india_desc: "Trade has this peculiar quality of being the most lucrative the further east you go. We should embrace this trend by establishing chartered companies in India. While we lack the financial expertise currently, we can hire scots and dutchmen to spearjead swedish inroads into India."
 swe_stormaktstiden_title: "Stormaktstiden"
 swe_stormaktstiden_desc: "The era of greatness has begun"
 swe_pomerania_title: "Svenska Pommern"
 swe_pomerania_desc: "Pomerania remains a great landing point into the Germany lands, as it has both close proximity to Stockholm and is influential in Baltic trade. While we could own the territories outright, their old archaic institutions such as serfdom, and the chaotic mess that is inheritance law makes vassalage more appealing."
 swe_eclipse_eagle_title: "Eclipse the Eagle"
 swe_eclipse_eagle_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, as ancient and innefective as it is, remains a hegemonic entity which stands in the way of our Dominium Matius Baltic. Therefore, we must strike at the right opportunity to rid ourselces of any southern threat."
 swe_deluge_title: "Syndadflod"
 swe_deluge_desc: "The Polish are also regional powers who threaten our Baltic mission. By delivering a decisive blow and destroying their nation, we can ensure that Poland will never be a credible threat again."
 swe_union_of_kedainai_title: "Kėdainiai Avtal"
 swe_union_of_kedainai_desc: "The Union of Kėdainiai  was an agreement between several magnates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the king of the Swedish Empire which aimed to dissolve the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and create a similar union, this time with Sweden as the head. The Lithuanian side was presented by Janus Radziwill, who merely wanted a strong bukwark against growing Russian influence. If we were to enact this union, it would make steering continental affairs much easier in the eyes of the crown."
 swe_mouth_of_neva_title: "Mouth of the Neva"
 swe_mouth_of_neva_desc: "The river Neva is vitally important to any power wishing to control the Baltic. It also is a very defensible position on the Karelian Isthmus, and therefore can easily be fortified well."
 swe_estonian_shores_title: "Estonian Shores"
 swe_estonian_shores_desc: "The closest land in proximity to Stockholm is Estonia, which has waned under the crusades. This means that they will be more inclined to accept our rule, and settlers."
 swe_livonian_war_title: "Livländska Kriget"
 swe_livonian_war_desc: "The Catholic orders wane in irrelevance. Ever since Grunwald, both the Teutonic and Livonian orders have struggled to project their power, and cannot fight against the heretical wave in the east. This means they are ripe for the taking. Many strategic cities such as Reval and Riga sit undefended, but the old institutions will be hard to weed out."
 swe_curtail_prussia_title: "Curtail the Prussians"
 swe_curtail_prussia_desc: "The Prussian port towns of the Baltic remain influential as ever, with the local confederation strangling any local government. If we want to retain relevance in the area, we must not only conquer the state, but also pacify the unruly towns, lest our own gain any bright ideas."
 swe_dominum_marius_baltici_title: "Dominum Marius Baltici"
 swe_dominum_marius_baltici_desc: "The one main goal of the Swedish state was clear; the complete control over the Baltic sea."
 swe_beyond_ladoga_title: "Beyond Ladoga"
 swe_beyond_ladoga_desc: "While the Novgorodian coastline is satisfactory to some, others believe that Sweden should take a more active role on its eastern frontier, not least because it is full of the wrong kind of christians. The ever growing Muscovite power appear to be alienating the northern boyarsm who are more than happy to help us reestablish their privileges; at least we can pretend to do so."
 swe_trans_baltic_dominion_title: "Trans-Baltic Dominion"
 swe_trans_baltic_dominion_desc: "Far from a wishful vision, the nobles of Sweden invision the blue and yellow flag flying beyond the baltic, from Gothenburg to Moscow. With Russia preoccupied with... something, now seems the perfect time to cement Swedish ownership of the old varangian lands."
 swe_baltic_rennovation_title: "Baltisk Renovering"
 swe_baltic_rennovation_desc: "No Baltic empire is complete without the relevant infrastructure, and with the sweeping reforms seen in Stockholm, we can finally entrench our baltic position, renovating the ports and shipyards, growing the towns and overriding any attempts by the German nobility to cling on to their ancestral rights. You love your ancestors so much why dont you become a pagan."
 swe_displays_of_strength_title: "Displays of Strength"
 swe_displays_of_strength_desc: "No king is really a king unless they can properly excersise their authority. What Sweden lacks is power outside of Stockholm, for its largest cities reside away from the core. A new capital must be built, or at the very least a city in which current trends in architectural styles are well reflected."
 swe_geat_revival_title: "Geat Revival"
 swe_geat_revival_desc: "Gothicism was a mainly Swedish cultural and patriotic movement that was linked to the Nordic past, which was perceived as a heroic era. The movement's members took their starting point in the idea that the ancient Goths had their original home in Sweden. The fathers of the movement are Nils Ragvaldsson, Ericus Olai, the brothers Johannes Magnus and Olaus Magnus, Johannes Bureus and Olof Rudbeck the Elder. The supposed Gothic heritage was used in propaganda during the great power era, where there was a will to incite the people to war by giving them something to fight for in the form of a grand story . Gothicists often focused on runes and runic languages, and their inherent historical heritage."
 swe_royal_majesty_title: "Kunglig Majestät"
 swe_royal_majesty_desc: "If the king is to be deemed royal, then all of the Riksdag must acknowledge this. If not, then executive action must be taken, for there is nothing more embarassing than a King castrated by his people"
 swe_gods_will_title: "Guds Vilja"
 swe_gods_will_desc: "With the recent reductions granting the crown a near monopoly over domestic affairs, the seeds have been sowed for autocracy unlike any seen before, founded on the theory of the Kingdom of God. The Riskdag needs to be thoroughly neutered before any proclamation can be made, but the future looks bright for the Carolian Autocracy."
 swe_machtstaat_title: "Machtstaat"
 swe_machtstaat_desc: "The King's authority may be absolute, but there is no point to limitless power if it is not obvious."

 ### EVENTS ###
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.t: "The Legacy of Engelbrekt"
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.d: "Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson is a legendary and an enigmatic figure. He lead an army of peasants and miners, furious at Denmark's crushing taxes and brutal sheriffs, rising up in open rebellion. Capturing castle after castle, Engelbrekt and his men soon controlled a greater part of Sweden. Alas, discontent amongst the Swedish nobles and Engelbrekt has resulted in his murder in 1436. With a similar situation in our hands we are now at a crossroad, we may either re-ignite the patriotic zeal that Engelbrekt has lit inside every true Swede, or not risk it all and stay stagnant for more time."
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.opt1: "His legacy shall live on!"
 ME_Sweden_Events.1.opt2: "We stand by Kalmar"

 ME_Sweden_Events.2.t: "Gustav Vasa - Parens Patriae"
 ME_Sweden_Events.2.d: "Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa nobe family, self recognized Riksföreståndare of Sweden, has finally delivered Sweden its long awaited freedom. With a Riksföreståndare as energeticly ruthless and skilled as Gustav, picking a monarch fit to rule our newly independent nation is a given. With German support to his rule, Gustav was crowned as king of Sweden in Strangnas Cathedral."
 ME_Sweden_Events.2.opt1: "The Hovitsman is King!"
 ME_Sweden_Events.2.opt2: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is fine"

 ME_Sweden_Events.3.t: "Stockholm Arises"
 ME_Sweden_Events.3.d: "Stockholm saw many ambitious city plans during Gustavus Adolphus' reign, in which the economy was tightly directed top-down. To this goal, cities were crucial as trade and industry was concentrated to cities where it was easier to control. The then suburban district of Norrmalm, just north of Stadsholmen, had been made a separate city with its own magistrate in 1602. This effectively made implementing any new city plan impossible as the inhabitants there refused to accept to have their homes demolished. This problem was solved in 1635 when Norrmalm was reunified with Stockholm, probably a necessary step for the planned regulations and another indication the entire development was dependent of the government and not the city itself.\n\nOn Malmarna, the surrounding ridges, the first suburb to catch the focus of Oxenstierna was the western part of Norrmalm. A city plan for the district, most likely developed by Anders Torstensson in early 1637, feature several still preserved structures, including Stoore Konnungz gatun and Mönstre Platz"
 ME_Sweden_Events.3.opt1: "Bring all the other cities on their feet!"

 ME_Sweden_Events.4.t: "Wallonian Immigration"
 ME_Sweden_Events.4.d: "Thousands of Walloons flocked to Sweden, partly due to religious persecution, but partly for the opportunities. Despite mining being the most lucrative produce, its industry was still relatively primitive. The decisive modernisation of the Swedish iron industry in fact took place at the beginning of the 17th century, where Dutch merchants began aiding the state in acquiring iron cannons from Sweden. A large number of forgers who had emigrated to Holland from Spanish controlled Wallonia were now recruited to work in Sweden at the Royal ironworks and armouries, modernised by engineers such as Willem de Besche and financed by businessmen such as Louis De Geer, who introduced the Walloon Process to Uppland."
 ME_Sweden_Events.4.opt1: "The steel industry roars!"
 ME_Sweden_Events.4.opt2: "Our industry is not open to foreigners"

 ME_Sweden_Events.5.t: "The Great Army Reform" 
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.d: "Gustavus understood the role of shock in combat, of delivering a stunning, smashing attack directly and bluntly into an enemy with the weight and force of a whole military unit. He maximized it by double-volley fire by infantry, hard charges by cavalry, and a range of big guns as well as small leather guns and regimental pieces. Gustavus adopted wheel-lock muskets that were much smaller and lighter than the heavy-caliber Spanish musket, a matchlock that required two men or a forked rest to fire. He greatly increased the proportion of musketeers to pikers in the ranks, enhancing infantry punching power. He even shortened pikes to 11 feet from the more common 18 to 21 feet, making his last pikers as light and maneuverable as the musketeers they protected from enemy horse. Three or four brigades formed a flexible, articulated, extended battle line. Each brigade subdivided into three squadrons of about 500 each, providing even more flexibility and chance to maneuver. Whenever flanked, Swedish infantry quickly articulated to bring musket volleys to bear from a newly right-angled line, along with easily repositioned one-and-a-half- or three-pounder guns. Reducing firing ranks to six and using double-volleys meant that all interior and back ranks had clear fields of fire, while each brigade was confident that half its number always stood ready with muskets loaded. Putting the regimental guns forward added killing range and firepower in mobile attack and defense."
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.opt1: "Re-purpose Polish shock cavalry"
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.opt2: "Adopt iron-cast artillery"
 ME_Sweden_Events.5.opt3: "Introduce wheel-lock muskets"

 ME_Sweden_Events.6.t: "Dutch Influence on Gothenburg"
 ME_Sweden_Events.6.d: "When founding Gothenburg, numerous foreign immigrants were invited to populate the city, with the majority coming from the Dutch Republic and Scotland. The initial city council comprised ten Dutchmen, seven Swedes and one Scot. Dutch builders were contracted to plan the new city and construct its fortifications, in part because of their expertise in building on marshland. In order to drain the swampy ground and provide access for shipping, Gothenburg was given a network of canals, akin to those of Dutch cities like Amsterdam, and indeed it appears the plans for the canal network were modelled on those used for the recent Dutch colonial settlement of Batavia. The Dutch influence over Gothenburg in its early decades was so strong that it was sometimes regarded as a Dutch colony on Swedish soil."
 ME_Sweden_Events.6.opt1: "Hire Dutch city planners"
 ME_Sweden_Events.6.opt2: "Här skall staden ligga!"

 ME_Sweden_Events.7.t: "Radziwill's Proposal"
 ME_Sweden_Events.7.d: "Janus Radziwill, the Hetman of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, is one of the most powerful people in the Commonwealth, and during the recent war he has increasingly favoured our side over the Polish. This has prompted him to ask for a union between Sweden and Lithuania, for reasons unkown but suspected to be due to our displays of supremacy."
 ME_Sweden_Events.7.opt1: "Enact the Union"
 ME_Sweden_Events.7.opt2: "We prefer direct rule"

 ME_Sweden_Events.8.t: "De la Gardie's Proposal" 
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.d: "Jacob de la Gardie, a french noble in service of the riksradet, engineered both the campagins against Poland and Muscovy, but in an interesting turn of events has proposed that Sweden establish a protectorate over the Rus lands as opposed to mere supremacy. We could elevate his title from simply a govenor general to Beskyddare of the Rus, or we could assume the title for ourselves and merely grant him the odd extra title that means nothing, like minister for fish tasting. This also allows closer cooperation with the Boyars, rather than supplanting them with Swedes. Then again, extending our influence through any means other than militarily sounds like more expense in the long run."
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.opt1: "Support De la Gardie's plans"
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.opt2: "Fish tasting it is!"
 ME_Sweden_Events.8.opt3: "Better to rule without internal opposition as well"

 ME_Sweden_Events.9.t: "Novgorod Besittning" 
 ME_Sweden_Events.9.d: "Now that the Novgorodians have been firmly destroyed, it seems that ruling over a large heretic population may be more challenging than anticipated. The cities of the north hold great value, but would be better off being run by locals. This would also help legitimise our claims to any further Russian excursion."
 ME_Sweden_Events.9.opt1: "Sweden will control Ingria, leave the rest to Novgorod"
 ME_Sweden_Events.9.opt2: "Novgorod is Ours!"

 ME_Sweden_Events.10.t: "Founding Karlskrona" 
 ME_Sweden_Events.10.d: "Karlskrona's location was strategic with controlled connections to the mainland and in the seafront framing archipelago. In 1681 military fortifications were erected to protect the naval base.The reason Sweden wanted to locate its navy  there was of course due to the fact that it wanted to manifest a position of power close to Denmark and the European continent. In addition, the port is ice-free most of the year. On August 10, 1680, Karlskrona received its city privileges , while Ronneby , which had previously lost its when Kristianopel was built, meant that Karlskrona's trade and growth increased when many of its inhabitants were forced to move there. People from Kristianopel also flocked after their Danish city was destroyed by the Swedes. Karlskrona also benefited from several years of duty-free during its construction. Shipbuilders for the new naval base with shipyards were picked up from Ostrobothnia and Stockholm. The first city plan, drawn up in 1683 by Erik Dahlbergh , Hans Wachtmeister and Carl Magnus Stuart , shows Karlskrona as a pure fortress. The 1694 plan by Erik Dahlberg, which was later followed, also provided space for urban development. Karlskrona soon became the kingdom's third largest city, after Riga and Stockholm."

 ME_Sweden_Events.11.t: "The Swedish Da Vinci" 
 ME_Sweden_Events.11.d: "Christopher Polhelm is a man of many inventions, most notably the Polhemslås. However, his expertise was spent for the state as well throughout the late 17th and early 18th centuries. His mining machines were emplyed at Falun, Bergslagen and Hällestad, and he established the Laboratorium Mechanicum in Stockholm, where he created a model collection for movement mechanisms; Polhem's mechanical alphabet.\n\nHis inventions were focused at manufacture, founding the Stjärnsund manufactory, with these same innovations being used at the cloth manufactory in Stockholm. His water works included Slussen in Stockholm and Polhemsdockan in Karlskrona, the latter of which attracted international attention for its advanced design. While dry docks in other countries were emptied of water by placing them above the tide limit, Polhemsdockan used water pumps, as the Baltic Sea has no tides to speak of."
 ME_Sweden_Events.11.opt1: "Such a man was not born for centuries."
 ME_Sweden_Events.11.opt2: "Let Polhelm fund his own work"

 ME_Sweden_Events.12.t: "Formations of the Caroleans" 
 ME_Sweden_Events.12.d: "The Carolingian army was created after Charles XI's decision to reform the Swedish army and navy through the introduction of the Indelningsverket, dealing with manpower shortages. At the end of the 1690s, the Swedish empire was able to muster a powerful army whose size was the largest relative to population.\n\n Carolean tactics were very offensive. It was a development of the French army under Louis XIV and was basically about rolling up the resistance with an attack. A powerful offensive would make the difference. Since during the Great Nordic War one often met numerically stronger opponents, the principle of never facing a hostile attack was stagnant. The courage, religion and belief in the king were very important for the offensive Carolean tactics to work. It was not said to matter much if you ducked or stood up straight because it was God's will if someone died; in this way the soldiers seldom crawled under the enemy's musket or artillery fire. The Go-To method was based on shock tactics and was, at the time, the Caroleans the most common combat technique in the Swedish army. This very aggressive tactic usually resulted in short-lived but successful battles against the enemy's superior numbers."
 ME_Sweden_Events.12.opt1: "Caroleans; go unto!"
