 MSA_navy_title: "Ambitions Across the Sea"

 ME_Malaya_Events.1.b: "We need to look inwards to achieve perfection."

 ME_Malaya_Events.2.t: "Expedition Launches"
 ME_Malaya_Events.2.d: "Our prepared expedition has finally launched. The grand flotilla, visible as far as eye can see, has embarked on the journey to Nanyang, as planned. Whether the new expedition will live up to the glory of the old ones - time will tell. However it is almost certain that this will be a ground-shaking event for the polities in the south."
 ME_Malaya_Events.2.a: "Sail! Bring glory to the Heavenly Throne!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.3.t: "Arrival of a Chinese Treasure Fleet"
 ME_Malaya_Events.3.d: "A chinese maritime expedition, much alike to the one lead by Zheng He, has arrived at one of our ports, wishing correspondence with the Monarch and a temporary stay. If we have learnt anything from the past, is that this is most certainly an important decision. Support of the emperor might be key to our growth!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.3.a: "Give them the best welcome our country is able to give!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.3.b: "A lukewarm welcome will suffice."
 ME_Malaya_Events.3.c: "They call themselves Sons of Heaven? Oh, the audacity!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.6.t: "The Chinese Expedition Departs?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.6.d: "It would seem that after weeks, even months, of our hospitality, the expedition is finally ready to return back to mainland China. Their stay has certainly been an important one, and we will forever remember this event in the pages of history."
 ME_Malaya_Events.6.a: "We bid you farewell!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.6.b: "Stay, we beg you!"


 ME_Malaya_Events.7.t: "Cease and Desist"
 ME_Malaya_Events.7.d: "The great Chinese Envoy Fleet has arrived at our coast, demanding we cease our vile pirate ways and succumb to the greatness of the emperor, else we might face dire consequences. While the fleet alone isn't probably able to fend off our flotilla, the allies of the Emperor are almost sure to threaten us."
 ME_Malaya_Events.7.a: "Out! We will listen to no emperor."
 ME_Malaya_Events.7.b: "So be it. It's time to end our evil ways."

 ME_Malaya_Events.8.t: "Call to Arms"
 ME_Malaya_Events.8.d: "The Chinese Expedition is urging our military intervention against the vile pirates on our doorstep. They are willing to provide assistance."
 ME_Malaya_Events.8.a: "Thy will be done, heavens!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.8.b: "Assure we will intervene."
 ME_Malaya_Events.8.c: "We don't have the time nor resources, sorry!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.9.t: "War with the Fleet"
 ME_Malaya_Events.9.d: "Due to our policies, the relations with the Chinese Expedition have gravely worsened, and we are in state of a swift yet deadly war."
 ME_Malaya_Events.9.a: "They are no one to fear."
 ME_Malaya_Events.9.b: "Dedicate all resources."

 ME_Malaya_Events.10.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Taken Into Custody"
 ME_Malaya_Events.10.d: "No one shall oppose the massive treasure fleet."

 #Here begin the ~25 flavor events for the expedition.
 #single and streamlined in nature.
 ME_Malaya_Events.20.t: "Expedition Demands Extradition"
 ME_Malaya_Events.20.d: "The Chinese Expedition has taken notice that there is a fugitive in our court. Indeed, it is believed in the mainland that they have committed treason against the Emperor. However, their skills are quite valuable to us. Should we really bow to the wishes of the Emperor?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.20.a: "Who are they to demand extradition?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.20.b: "Most certainly."
 ME_Malaya_Events.20.c: "A skilled minister you say?"

 ME_Malaya_Events.21.t: "Scandal at the Court"
 ME_Malaya_Events.21.d: "During one of the usual court carousing, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has stirred up some real scandal. And while it is certainly uncomfortable for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], this presents a much bigger danger, as many ministers have turned their backs on the leadership. But what if [Root.Monarch.GetName] were to find a scapegoat?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.21.a: "Take the blame and move on."
 ME_Malaya_Events.21.b: "Those travellers, it's their fault!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.22.t: "Desecration of a Holy Site"
 ME_Malaya_Events.22.d: "Some of the travellers have been presented our holy places. However, in a rather unexpected turn of events, one of them has committed an act much of us find gravely insulting. Completely unaware of etiquette, they have disrespected us and our tradition! The traveller has already received a slap to their face, much to the anger of their peers."
 ME_Malaya_Events.22.a: "They had no right to know. Punish the aggressor!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.22.b: "It happens."
 ME_Malaya_Events.22.c: "They did what!?"

 ME_Malaya_Events.23.t: "Exotic Animals"
 ME_Malaya_Events.23.d: "From all the legends that arise from the Chinese court and through all the descriptions of the exotic animals Zheng He has brought to China, it would not be unreasonable to think that the sailors would be interested in our exotic fauna. After all, they would be greatly rewarded for the gifts they were able to acquire."
 ME_Malaya_Events.23.a: "Give them our most exotic animals. Spare no expenses!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.23.b: "Simply show them the animals."
 ME_Malaya_Events.23.c: "What if the animals scare them away…?"

 ME_Malaya_Events.24.t: "Drunken Sailor Causes Disruption"
 ME_Malaya_Events.24.d: "One of the sailors, part of the expedition's crew, has decided to spend their night in a rather unusual matter. Clearly seeking to find new friends amongst the [Root.GetAdjective] populace, they went out to taste the local beverages. And in his jolly carousing, he seems to have gone a bit too far. The petty squabbles between him and some of the belligerent drinkers seem to have caused an allout free for all."
 ME_Malaya_Events.24.a: "We will tolerate none of that!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.24.b: "Their supervisors know, they will be punished."
 ME_Malaya_Events.24.c: "Let us pretend nothing actually happened."

 ME_Malaya_Events.25.t: "Faux Pas"
 ME_Malaya_Events.25.d: "Many of the higher-ranking officials from the Expeditions have been presented many of our customs and religious hotspots our country has to offer. However, due to their ignorance, they have laid their hands on an idol, quite close to the hearts of the local population. This blunder has been interpreted as an insult by our side."
 ME_Malaya_Events.25.a: "Get your hands away right now!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.25.b: "They will be blessed!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.26.t: "Exploitative Costs"
 ME_Malaya_Events.26.d: "Local [Root.GetAdjective] officials have been met with an interesting report filed by many of the Expeditions' sailors. It would seem that, in the spirit of opportunism, many of the merchants stationed in the port have raised their prices considerably. The plaintiffs even went as far as to call it exploitative."
 ME_Malaya_Events.26.a: "Such is free trade!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.26.b: "Force the merchants to lower prices."
 ME_Malaya_Events.26.c: "We will do the best we can."

 ME_Malaya_Events.27.t: "Nobles are Worried"
 ME_Malaya_Events.27.d: "It's pretty clear that much of the Nobility is displeased with our handling of the Expedition. Initially, this sentiment was rather hidden, and no one was brave enough to oppose our handling of the situation, but as people slowly began to gossip, and with the various dramas that ensued, the sentiment seems to be quite visible now. In fact, open requests have been made to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to amend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ways."
 ME_Malaya_Events.27.a: "They might be right."
 ME_Malaya_Events.27.b: "I know better than all of you!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.28.t: "Translator’s Dilemma"
 ME_Malaya_Events.28.d: "It would seem like the Expedition has made a mistake. It is quite apparent that the translator aboard the ship is unable to understand our language and provide service. As such it is impossible for us to communicate."
 ME_Malaya_Events.28.a: "There’s a universal language that they are sure to understand - gestures!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.28.b: "We will just have to wait until a new translator arrives."
 ME_Malaya_Events.28.c: "Look for a translator in other cities."

 ME_Malaya_Events.29.t: "Local Dislike"
 ME_Malaya_Events.29.d: "The court and the monarch do like the presence of the distant travellers. However, the common folk in the capital city seem to be rather upset about them. This has resulted in open hostilities between the two parties at many occasions, and has made the expedition rather wary about interacting with locals."
 ME_Malaya_Events.29.a: "The dislike is unwarranted!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.29.b: "Do something!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.30.t: "Navigator Requests our Maps"
 ME_Malaya_Events.30.d: "One of the navigators aboard the expeditions' ships has certainly taken notice of our seafaring techniques. They have determined we know of trade routes not familiar to them, and are asking us to share our maps with them."
 ME_Malaya_Events.30.a: "We won’t give up our secrets so easily!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.30.b: "Share all maps."
 ME_Malaya_Events.30.c: "Share the least significant portion of them."

 ME_Malaya_Events.31.t: "Expedition's Leaders Impress Sailors"
 ME_Malaya_Events.31.d: "The chinese military recruiters are certainly impressed by our seamen. So impressed in fact, that they have begun trying to impress our sailors into their treasure fleet."
 ME_Malaya_Events.31.a: "Yeah... no."
 ME_Malaya_Events.31.b: "Impressive!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.31.c: "They can even take our ships!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.31.e: "Absolutely not! Jail the perpetrators!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.32.t: "Expedition Displeased by the Quality of Our Tribute"
 ME_Malaya_Events.32.d: "Despite our most generous gifts, the expedition seems to be rather displeased with the quality of our tribute. They seem to be expecting more from us. How can this be? We have provided much more than they deserve, and yet they have the audacity to complain."
 ME_Malaya_Events.32.a: "They are looking for a fight!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.32.b: "Devote more resources to our gifts."

 ME_Malaya_Events.33.t: "Chinese Reward our Hospitality"
 ME_Malaya_Events.33.d: "Our most generous gifts have finally been met with mutual respect! The expedition, impressed by our hospitality, has decided to gift us some of their world-renowned wares. We are honored by their respect towards us."
 ME_Malaya_Events.33.a: "Thank you!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.33.b: "Is this really all you have?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.33.c: "Thank you, but keep it for yourselves."

 ME_Malaya_Events.34.t: "Powerful Garrison"
 ME_Malaya_Events.34.d: "The expedition carries with itself not just the diplomats, sailors and officials. The expedition also brings forth soldiers and the military. And so it would seem that a powerful regiment has been stationed in one of our ports... Could this mean hostile takeover? Our officials are surely worried."
 ME_Malaya_Events.34.a: "Impose some restrictions!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.34.b: "Their presence is a form of defense, you know..."

 ME_Malaya_Events.35.t: "An Unwelcome Affair"
 ME_Malaya_Events.35.d: "It would seem that one of the daughters of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has gotten into a love affair with one of the sailors stationed in the port. There's been gossips around this for a while, but only now has it been actually discovered those were true. They seem to have been meeting for weeks by now!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.35.a: "Princess and a common sailor!?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.35.b: "Love knows no bounds!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.36.t: "Foreign Drill Master"
 ME_Malaya_Events.36.d: "Aboard the expedition are many exceptional persons. Diplomats, officers, artisans, merchants. Even experts on the military treatise. Indeed! One of them has offered us their services. With their help, we will be able to punch much above our weight."
 ME_Malaya_Events.36.a: "You know nothing!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.36.b: "Very well!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.37.t: "Chinese Gift Us their Porcelain"
 ME_Malaya_Events.37.d: "The Chinese Expedition brings forth prosperity, wealth, power and most importantly, gifts. And among those gifts is the famous Chinaware, revered in all of Asia and far beyond."
 ME_Malaya_Events.37.a: "It is not as great as it is said to be."
 ME_Malaya_Events.37.b: "Brilliant ware!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.38.t: "Chinese Gift Us Silk"
 ME_Malaya_Events.38.d: "It would seem that [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets to dress like a true Chinese Emperor, for the expedition has gifted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] brand new silk, imported from China, manufactory-new. And it does seem to suit them quite well!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.38.a: "We can make better cloth!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.38.b: "This will make a fine addition to our collections!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.38.c: "Fantastic! We need more!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.39.t: "Ship Repairs Needed"
 ME_Malaya_Events.39.d: "It would seem that during one of the recent voyages, the Expeditions' flotilla has been struck by a violent storm. Much of the fleet has been greatly damaged, and the officers expect us to lend them our ports, much needed for repair. However, our ports are not ready for such amounts of ship, which will temporarily freeze our exchange and greatly anger the harbormasters."
 ME_Malaya_Events.39.a: "We cannot hold so many ships, sorry."
 ME_Malaya_Events.39.b: "Force the foreign merchants to give their spaces up."
 ME_Malaya_Events.39.c: "We must accommodate the expedition by all means possible."

 ME_Malaya_Events.40.t: "Wisdom of the Generals"
 ME_Malaya_Events.40.d: "We have managed to befriend much of the Expedition's High Command. While this friendship is mostly mutual respect and trust, we could take the relationship further and actually share our most guided secrets with them, perhaps learning somehow in return."
 ME_Malaya_Events.40.a: "Why, yes, of course!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.40.b: "That sounds like an awful idea."

 ME_Malaya_Events.41.t: "An Invite to Further Travels"
 ME_Malaya_Events.41.d: "The High Command of the Expedition has sent an envoy to [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.GetHerHim]self. It would seem like [Root.GetSheHe] has been invited to further travellers by the side of the expedition! How should we react?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.41.a: "Absolutely not!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.41.b: "We will send out diplomats?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.41.c: "We can spare some time!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.42.t: "Proposal to Establish Chinese Trading Outpost"
 ME_Malaya_Events.42.d: "The oligarchs of the Expedition have put forward a much curious proposal, a Trading Outpost in one of our posts. This would mean establishing permanent trade relationship with the Mandate of Heaven, but at the same time we would have to devote many of our resources into the upkeep of this relationship."
 ME_Malaya_Events.42.a: "To grow the trade in the Southern Seas? of course!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.42.b: "We cannot."

 ME_Malaya_Events.43.t: "Assistance in War"
 ME_Malaya_Events.43.d: "While the business doesn't like war, some businessmen find their profits in war. As such, many aboard the Expedition have offered us their assistance in war. Should we really turn down their humble offer?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.43.a: "Of Course!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.43.b: "We can handle it on our own."

 ME_Malaya_Events.44.t: "Expedition Pleased by Pacifism"
 ME_Malaya_Events.44.d: "It is not a mystery that war is bad for business. Indeed, many countries visited by expedition were waging war at the time, which has turned away many of the potential merchants towards our country. The Expedition views our country as the beacon of peace, and the rate of exchange between our merchants is growing day by day."
 ME_Malaya_Events.44.a: "We were never warmongers."
 ME_Malaya_Events.44.b: "Is that so?"

 ME_Malaya_Events.45.t: "Dealing with the Beliefs"
 ME_Malaya_Events.45.d: "Islam of Malaya is quite Mystical in nature, with many of the origin stories of the various sultanates being based on tales. This is much to do with the background of how the faith spread to those regions, that being the arrival of foreign merchants and the conversion of the elite, which left the commons slowly converting and merging their faith with the local beliefs."
 ME_Malaya_Events.45.a: "Enforce Legalism"
 ME_Malaya_Events.45.b: "We will tolerate some syncretism."
 ME_Malaya_Events.45.c: "And those tales are true!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.46.t: "Recording our Annals"
 ME_Malaya_Events.46.d: "Our clergy has gathered in order to write up the origin history of our state. We could give it a mystical feeling, much alike to many other origin stories in the area, or a more literal, legalist approach. The choice is ultimately ours."
 ME_Malaya_Events.46.a: "Mystical is our state."
 ME_Malaya_Events.46.b: "Let us write a more legalistic approach."

 ME_Malaya_Events.47.t: "Pilgrims Arrive from [From.GetName] En Masse"
 ME_Malaya_Events.47.d: "[From.GetAdjective]' ambitions to safeguard pilgrim routes have resulted in a upsurge of pilgrims coming from the archipelago. As such, a new wave of pilgrims is arriving in [Root.GetName] as a result. May praise be!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.47.a: "Welcome, faithful!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.48.t: "Pilgrims from [From.GetName] En Route"
 ME_Malaya_Events.48.d: "It would seem that our ports have become a hotspot for the hajj pilgrims coming from [From.GetName]. Indeed, pilgrims from Malaya have their hotspots in Banda Aceh and in ports of southern India. What should we do with this newly acquired influence over the pilgrims?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.48.a: "Welcome them in [Root.GetName]!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.48.b: "Fascinating Religion..."
 ME_Malaya_Events.48.c: "Brilliant! Tax them."

 ME_Malaya_Events.49.t: "Cantonese Malay Community"
 ME_Malaya_Events.49.d: "With the unification of the Archipelago and our growing interests in the Nanban trade, many of our merchants have made the Chinese Canton their home. As such, a generation of merchants of mixed ancestry emerged, loyal to us, and able to serve our interests. We have been blessed!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.49.a: "We will make use of this!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.50.t: "[Root.GetName] - A Muslim Center"
 ME_Malaya_Events.50.d: "The Muslim Merchants and Islam arrived in Nusantara as early as the 12th century, but it would not be until much later that the spread of the new religion would accelerate. First Sultanate of Indonesia can be considered Peureulak, soon followed by Samudera Pasai. However, it is only after the foundation of Malacca Sultanate, that the spread of Islam would accelerate. In 1444, [596.GetName] is the center of Islam in Southeast Asia, to which scholars from the Dar-ar Islam arrive. Those scholars would then travel and proselytize the religion to other parts of the Archipelago."
 ME_Malaya_Events.50.a: "Fascinating."

 ME_Malaya_Events.51.t: "Importing Spice Crops"
 ME_Malaya_Events.51.d: "Hazardous land once unknown and foreign to us has been conquered. Our settlers have firmly defeated this harsh land. The lands called Australia are now well within our grasp. Yet this land doesn't bring much to the crown currently, some exotic creatures and much gold. Perhaps we should appropriate some of the land here for other means. Perhaps our merchants should allow some of our spice crops to be grown in Australia? I am confident this can only be a positive!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.51.a: "Surely this won't spell an ecological disaster."
 ME_Malaya_Events.51.b: "Horrible idea!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.51.c: "Introduce rabbits instead!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.52.t: "The Trustworthy Merchants of [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Malaya_Events.52.d: "Every traveller think highly of our merchants. Respected for their honesty, they are a prized possession of our society. Indeed, much of our success is attributed to their traits. [Root.GetName] would not be the same without their busy traders."
 ME_Malaya_Events.52.a: "This is great to hear."
 ME_Malaya_Events.52.b: "They will be rewarded!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.53.t: "Production with a Purpose"
 ME_Malaya_Events.53.d: "The archipelago is home to a wide variety of different woods, exotic to pretty much every other region on Earth. Truly, our land is blessed with the best of the best. Our woodworking can serve many different purposes, from simple timber for shipbuilding, to creating furniture to extracting pleasant incense."
 ME_Malaya_Events.53.a: "The Incense serves [Root.Religion.GetName] well..."
 ME_Malaya_Events.53.b: "Splendid Wood for Splendid Furniture."
 ME_Malaya_Events.53.c: "Use the wood for shipbuilding!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.54.t: "United in Vassalage"
 ME_Malaya_Events.54.d: "Our kin in [From.GetAdjective], a nation much more powerful and one that we owe to much of our existence to, have requested us to bow to them in an act of vassalage. Indeed, they have given us a proposal to become a part of their empire. Should we accept?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.54.a: "Yes, we will bow down to [From.GetAdjective]."
 ME_Malaya_Events.54.b: "We value our independence."

 ME_Malaya_Events.56.t: "Incident in the Strait"
 ME_Malaya_Events.56.d: "The morning of [GetDate] began like any other. The cold morning breeze has concealed all of the coast in a dense mist. However, as the morning ended and the mist settled, out of the invisible emerged a flotilla of ships. Ships that we've not quite seen before. Those vessels were clearly sailing towards Malacca - the heart of the Empire. It is almost certain that this was no ordinary trading caravan. This was a completely foreign empire on an exploratory voyage, now at the footstep of [Root.GetAdjective] Empire. Those ships are of @[From.GetTag] [From.GetName] and it is not certain what their intentions might be."
 ME_Malaya_Events.56.a: "Fiends! Blow those ships up, for those are not trading partners, those are conquerors!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.56.b: "More trading partners means more coin."

 ME_Malaya_Events.57.t: "Hostility of the Malays"
 ME_Malaya_Events.57.d: "One of our chartered mercantile expedition has met a tragic fate in the Straits of Malacca. Indeed, the vile [From.Country.GetTitle] has ordered our trade ships bombarded, and only few survivors have lived to tell the tale. It would seem that developing trade connections with that nation might be difficult."

 ME_Malaya_Events.59.d: "Nusantara has always been a melting pot of different cultures and religions. It wasn't until our meteoric rise that one distinct religious unity was brought to the region, and the faith that has united the area is Islam. Now, will we stay true and faithful to our traditions? After all, the landscape is everchanging."
 ME_Malaya_Events.59.a: "We are faithful and will remain so!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.59.b: "Perhaps we have other plans..."

 ME_Malaya_Events.60.t: "Religious Zeal - Hinduism"
 ME_Malaya_Events.60.d: "The first organized societies in Nusantara were formed as a result of gradual Indianization. The faith was brought by waters and brahmans arriving from India, and has eversince coexisted with the similarly imported Buddhism, forming a unique blend of two unique to the region. Will we uphold these traditions?"

 ME_Malaya_Events.65.t: "The Fall of Muslim Sultanates"
 ME_Malaya_Events.65.d: "The genesis of Islam in India can be traced back to the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in late 12th century. Since then, Muslim Sultanates dominated the political life in the subcontinent, living a symbiotic relationship with their mostly hindu subjects. This would soon change though, as the Hindu Rajas have conducted a counterstrike campaign against them, effectively removing Muslim Rule from India."

If [ME_MSA_muslim_center_target.Owner.GetName] is unable to stop this trend, our growing city is bound to soon seize the status of the Muslim Center."
 ME_Malaya_Events.69.a: "Great!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.70.t: "[ME_MSA_muslim_center_target.GetName] is Triumphant"
 ME_Malaya_Events.70.d: "Due to the keen policies of [ME_MSA_muslim_center_target.Owner.GetName], much of the muslim travellers visiting [ME_MSA_muslim_center_target_rival.GetName] have been diverted to [ME_MSA_muslim_center_target.GetName].

 ME_Malaya_Events.71.a: "Great News!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.72.t: "The Sharp Weakening of Islam"
 ME_Malaya_Events.72.d: "As a result of the policies of other polities in the area, the muslims have began to lose ground, turning the land that once was destined to fully convert to an area barely dominated by the muslim polities. In such environment, little muslim travellers want to trade in Malaya, and prefer to look for wealth elsewhere."
 ME_Malaya_Events.72.a: "Ok."

 ME_Malaya_Events.73.t: "Muslims Restore Ground"
 ME_Malaya_Events.73.d: "Many thought it impossible, but the Islamic polities of the area managed to make a grand comeback, regaining control over many key cities and once again creating a sprawling environment for the spread of Islam in Southeast Asia. It is almost certain this is a region-changing event."

 ME_Malaya_Events.74.t: "Muslim Center Conquered!"
 ME_Malaya_Events.74.d: "The armies of [Root.GetName] have swept through the city like a herd of bisons. Most of the city has been looted to the brim and the province, controlled by a foreign power, may no longer serve the purpose of being the center for Muslims in Malaya. That being said, most muslims now travel to [ME_MSA_new_center.GetName]."
 ME_Malaya_Events.74.a: "Islam grows weaker."

 ME_Malaya_Events.76.t: "Spread of Islam"
 ME_Malaya_Events.76.d: "Islam has spread to [Root.GetName]! The community of the muslims in the province has outgrown the local population and the province can now be considered [Root.Religion.GetName]."
 ME_Malaya_Events.76.a: "Alright."

 ME_Malaya_Events.77.t: "Religious Zeal - Christianity"
 ME_Malaya_Events.77.d: "The Christianity has been spreading in our region for a while, having converted many of the animist peoples. Today, the missionaries came to the monarch himself, seeking his conversion."

 ME_Malaya_Events.82.t: "Lack of Sailors"
 ME_Malaya_Events.82.d: "Skilled seafarers, the Cantonese-Malay trader community is prized for its excellent sailing abilities. Despite that, there is a clear lack of men to board their ships, which is slowing down the growth of their community. Should we send some of ours?"
 ME_Malaya_Events.82.a: "We can spare a few."
 ME_Malaya_Events.82.b: "We need them on war!"

 ME_Malaya_Events.83.t: "Fiscal Troubles"

 ME_Malaya_Events.83.a: "Indeed, let us do that."
 ME_Malaya_Events.83.b: "Sounds like a bad idea."

 ME_Malaya_Events.84.t: "Community in Ruin"
 ME_Malaya_Events.84.d: "The local authorities have decided to crack down on the economic ventures of the community. Unless we do quick, decisive and preventive action, the community is bound to shrink considerably."
