 #Berar Missions
 berar_begin_the_mines_title: "More Copper Needed"
 berar_begin_the_mines_desc: "Our capital at Illichipur is quite poor in comparison to the likes of Bijapur, Bidar, and Golconda. The rougher terrain is not as easy to settle on, but the copper mines in and around our capital city make building on this land worth it. Whether it is used in weaponry or building material or some other regular usage, the copper flowing from Illichipur will fuel our upstart state."
 berar_in_the_fray_title: "A Spark to Ignite"
 berar_in_the_fray_desc: "The Sultanate of Bahmanis is in ruins but the nobles appointed to the five states are not lost! We of Berar, just like those of the other sultanates that broke away, can see just how tense politics are. A single move from someone in Deccan could trigger a cascade of conflicts coming forth, but who will make this first move? Whoever it may be, we need to ensure that our military is prepared in every possible way."
 berar_the_loyalty_at_home_title: "Satiate the Majority"
 berar_the_loyalty_at_home_desc: "As with all other sultanates in this grand subcontinent, we of Berar are a Muslim minority ruling over a Hindu majority. It is of no use attempting to enforce an orthodox and stringent view on Islam in Berar, therefore we must turn to working with Hindus and their spiritual caste, the Brahmins, to maintain order in the land. If we can work with the Brahmins effectively and integrate them into our royal court, Berar will be set for a prosperous future."
 berar_learned_family_title: "Books & Tomes"
 berar_learned_family_desc: "The integration of Hindu people into the administration of Berar has been a slow process, but one that is fruitful in what it brings. Books and tomes in the Kannada language as well as neighboring the Telugu and Marathi languages are slowly streaming into our royal court, allowing for greater insights into a plethora of subjects from natural science and poetry to military strategy and geography. Buying more of these books and encouraging our court to read these writings regularly would really help bring a more educated atmosphere to our court, would it not?"
 berar_digging_deeper_title: "Deeper Prospects"
 berar_digging_deeper_desc: "Copper is flowing nicely out from Illichipur thanks to our previous investments of time, money, and manpower, but as time goes on, we are seeing that iron is have a larger usage in making weapon parts both large and small. If we can dig deeper into the earth and make more secure mining operations in Illichipur, we will surely be able to begin harvesting iron in larger scales in our capital province."
 berar_cannon_foundries_title: "Smelt, Cast, and Refine!"
 berar_cannon_foundries_desc: "Our foundations in the Deccan are firm, but not permanent as some people in Berar might think. Should a large enough power from the north or south strike at us, we could face total defeat and subjugation as well as looted cities. In order to take preventative measures against this possible future, we need to concentrate on the way of future warfare: the way of the cannon! And what is the first step in this process of perfecting our artillery? Setting up proper foundries to smelt various ores, cast the metal into pieces, and refine the ways in which our own cannons are used in battle."
 berar_mortar_refinement_title: "Mortars and Bombards"
 berar_mortar_refinement_desc: "The foundries of Berar are ready for production, but is our military ready for what comes next in the future of military technology? Perhaps they are not, but that doesn't mean we should let them stand idly by. Using our foundries to make new designs of mortars and bombards for our military to test out will help refine our designs over time and give us a distinct edge when it comes to sieges."
 berar_field_guns_title: "Casting of Field Guns"
 berar_field_guns_desc: "The more effective the cannon, the better results we will see. That is the general notion of things with regards to our artillery, but as our cannons become more mobile and more powerful for the field of battle, we need to ensure that our crews manning the cannons can aim, fire, and reload them in the best possible manner. Once we have a handle on our training of artillery crews, any cannons we utilize will be even more effective than before."
 berar_large_and_in_charge_title: "The Sanctity of Berar"
 berar_large_and_in_charge_desc: "Growing to be a large state with various communities of different languages and faiths is troubling in some respects, but it is a test of how versatile and stable the nation truly is. Berar's growth is going to be met with internal resistance that must be sorted out as peacefully as possible so that prosperity can be had at all levels of society. Who knows what kind of scholars and great people might come to our land if they see it as both stable and prosperous."
 berar_variety_of_production_title: "New Sources of Money"
 berar_variety_of_production_desc: "Slowly the world is opening up to new trade routes as well as new materials and crops going across various regions and continents. Berar is only just now getting introduced to some of these interesting new crops and materials, but already some of our communities are taking to them quickly so that they can turn over a nice profit. If we can embrace this coming tide of new things and integrate our economy with them, we will undoubtedly see a rise in our economic output."
 berar_the_growing_estates_title: "Growth in All Forms"
 berar_the_growing_estates_desc: "Berar is nothing if not a constantly changing and evolving entity when looked at up close. From the changes we see happening in more urbanized communities to changes witnessed in the halls of temples and mosques, it is becoming very clear that tensions will rise up in our provinces if we cannot adapt to these changing times. Taking the time to hear out the various societal classes we encompass can ease some of this tension and provide new insights for our administration."
 berar_secure_to_the_center_title: "Defend our Fortunes"
 berar_secure_to_the_center_desc: "Just as we are adapting to changes all around us, we must dedicate time and money to ensuring that explosive changes that are hostile to Berar as a whole are not able to reach the heart of our state; not without a great effort, at least. Constructing fortifications not only in our capital, but across our growing state as a whole will bring a sense of security and ease to many in Berar across all social classes."
 berar_academy_of_gunpowder_title: "Class is in Session"
 berar_academy_of_gunpowder_desc: "While we of Berar pride ourselves on just how good our artillery pieces are and how much we have produced up to now, we are reliant on an old system when it comes to educating our members of our military at all levels. We should look to formalizing how education is done inside our military so that actual crucial lessons, tactics, and strategies may be passed down to the next generation. The best cannon in the world is nothing if the crew manning it is inept."
 berar_more_and_more_production_title: "Industrial Scales"
 berar_more_and_more_production_desc: "The dawn of new production methods as well as new ways of spreading information in general has frightened quite a few in the administration of Berar. We must turn this attitude around and instead be not afraid of these new innovations despite their possible malicious uses; we should be keen on turning them into ways that we can encourage our people to produce more for the same amount or even less work! We can even spread proper instructions of these new production methods and start gathering up resources for actual large manufactories to be built."


 #Deccani Missions
 berar_five_cities_five_successors_title: "Five Cities - Five States"
 berar_five_cities_five_successors_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Sultanate of Bahmanis, we have been left to struggle and fight for an existence that seems almost doomed at times. We are not alone in this though, as there are other cities in the former Deccani state that have gained prominence and power amidst the collapse.\nAhmednagar, Berar, Bijapur, and Golconda, all have aspirations for reuniting the lands of Bahmanis into one whole state and the city of Bidar itself is also trying to make itself a standing political figure still. We must not delay our conquest nor become stagnant in this quickly shifting political climate; we must steady ourselves and strike when the times are right so that our safety and power is secured."
 berar_the_battle_of_talikota_title: "Bulwark of the Deccan"
 berar_the_battle_of_talikota_desc: "The largest threat to us as of now is the Hindu powers to the south, most notably the Vijayanagara Empire. Though the power of the Sultanate of Bahmanis is but a memory now, with the consolidation of the five key cities of the Deccan under our authority we can effectively push back the Hindu encroachment from the south. The legacy of our predecessor will not be tarnished so easily!"
 berar_khandesh_and_vijayangara_title: "The Deccani Wars"
 berar_khandesh_and_vijayangara_desc: "There is much to be gained through conquering the Deccan and its lucrative cities, bountiful fields, and productive mines. We are not alone in seeing this, however, as those in the north and south are still willing to challenge our hegemony over the region as a whole. Let us draw our sword and meet these foes in battle for we will have to wage not just one single war to win over what is rightfully ours, but multiple wars that will dictate the very future of our empire and the fate of millions of people on the subcontinent."
 berar_unite_the_region_title: "Nizam-ul-Mulk"
 berar_unite_the_region_desc: "What it means to be a good Nizam (roughly meaning 'governor') and leader of the Deccan is hard to nail down. So many facets are required to be a competent administrator alone, but the challenges of the Deccan such as cultural clashes and religious confluences make it so that a truly benevolent and just Nizam-ul-Mulk (roughly meaning 'Governor of the Realm') will be hard to come by. We must never cease in our endeavor to make this happen though, since controlling the entirety of the Deccan will challenge our administration and its primary leadership time and time again. Truly we must look toward building a stable and prosperous future under a rightful Nizam."
 berar_chowmahalla_palace_title: "Chowmahalla Palace"
 berar_chowmahalla_palace_desc: "With our conquests throughout the Deccan complete and our military still embarking on conquests in neighboring regions, there are some within our dynasty and administration who think it would do us well to have a proper seat of residence. One of the most nominated candidate cities for this is near Golconda. Now, Golconda is prosperous and valuable of course, but the burgeoning city of Hyderabad nearby does not experience as many water shortages and as such would be a fitting place for a new palace of great detail and prestige. In time, as we plan out this new palace for our dynasty, we can formulate it into an administrative center of sorts, but that will only be in conjunction with it being the crowning achievement to our long line of conquests."
