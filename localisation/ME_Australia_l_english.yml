Far over hill and field it echoed and so compelling was that call that §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! himself almost turned and dashed back. His horse reared and neighed. \n\"Finally, we have arrived in the Eastern islands. A great deed will be necessary if we want to make the most of these lands. It may lead them to ruin for some time, but it will benefit us henceforth. We can even leave these lands be and allow them to prosper. What will it be, my lord?\""
