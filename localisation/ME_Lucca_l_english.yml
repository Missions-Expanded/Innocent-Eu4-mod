 luc_legacy_castruccio_castracani_title: "Castruccio Castracani"
 luc_legacy_castruccio_castracani_desc: "Castruccio Castracani was a Duke of Lucca, famous condottiere and protagonist of Machiavelli's "Life of Castruccio Castracani". Notably, he defeated the Florentines at the battle of Altopascio and captured their carrocio, which was subsequently paraded in the streets of Lucca during his Roman Triumph in the city."
 luc_walls_lucca_title: "Walls of Lucca"
 luc_walls_lucca_desc: "The old walls built by our forefathers do not enclose the newer parts of the city and are obsolete due to recent innovations in military technology. If we are to defend the city, we will need funds to construct a new set of city walls and to upgrade the old walls."
 luc_luccan_trading_ports_title: "Luccan Trading Ports"
 luc_luccan_trading_ports_desc: "With the port of Pisa secured, we can now focus on expanding the trade capacity of our ports along the coast."
 luc_tutta_seta_porta_lucca_title: "Tutta La Seta Porta a Lucca"
 luc_tutta_seta_porta_lucca_desc: "As the historical centre of the European silk trade, we should constantly strive to outpace our competitors and remain relevant. Building a manfactory for this purpose will be very helpful for this."

 luc_northern_allies_title: "Northern Allies"
 luc_northern_allies_desc: "Less than two decades ago, we were only saved from Florentine domination due to intervention on the part of Milan and Genoa. Thus, we should cement our alliances with nations north of us if we wish to counter Florentine influence from the south, otherwise we may have to pivot towards Florence."
 luc_take_pisa_title: "Take Pisa"
 luc_take_pisa_desc: "With the threat of invasion staved off, we can now focus on taking the port of Pisa. The port on the Arno river is an important centre of trade that could potentially threaten our own interests, and we would be remiss not to bring it into our possession if possible."
 luc_end_florence_title: "End Florence"
 luc_end_florence_desc: "Florence has been a thorn in our side for far too long. They cannot be allowed to threaten us anymore. Now that the port of Pisa is no longer under their control, the fall of the city of Florence shall be imminent."

 luc_volto_santo_lucca_title: "Il Volto Santo di Lucca"
 luc_volto_santo_lucca_desc: "Lucca has always been an important stop for pilgrims on the Via Francigena, not least due to the presence of the Holy Face of Lucca, said to have been carved right after Christ was placed in his tomb. A succession of miracles led to the Holy Face being brought from the Holy Land to the port of our ancient rival, Luni, where they found they could not bring it into the city. It was the Bishop of Lucca, warned by an angel of its arrival in Luni, who was able to bring it back to the Church of San Frediano in Lucca, where it then miraculously appeared in the Church of San Martino the next day. As the number of pilgrims decrease due to the wars in Italy, we should renovate San Martino and build a new tempietto or chapel shrine just for the Holy Face, in hopes that we might attract more pilgrims."
 luc_marmo_carrara_title: "Marmo Carrara"
 luc_marmo_carrara_desc: "Called 'Luni Marble' after our ancient rivals in Ancient Rome, the marble from the quarries of Carrara have been prized by artisans all over Europe, especially the pure white Statuario. We should establish an Uffcio del Marmo in order to better manage the extraction of marble and build a fleet capable of defending our exports."
 luc_city_siena_title: "City of Siena"
 luc_city_siena_desc: "The conquest of the hilltop city of Siena will be very useful for securing our position  in Tuscany. As an added bonus, we will be bound to have more influence over Rome by virtue of proximity alone."
 luc_independence_secured_title: "Independence Secured"
 luc_independence_secured_desc: "WIth the Tuscany area secured our independence is no longer as precarious as before. Although we may not be able to stand against the Great Powers and Hegemons on our own, with the right allies we will not be simple pushovers either."

 luc_cavalieri_tau_title: "Cavalieri del Tau"
 luc_cavalieri_tau_desc: "Now that we have settled our relations with the Pope, the Order of Saint James of Altopascio, or the Knights of Tau have asked for our support. Possibly the earliest Christian institution to provide a charity hospital, protection for pilgrims and a military branch, this certainly seems like a worthy cause, especially with the current political situation."
 luc_bagni_lucca_title: "Bagni di Lucca"
 luc_bagni_lucca_desc: "Known for its hot springs since ancient Roman times, the healing properties of the water of the Baths of Lucca have long provided foreign dignataries with a summer retreat, and vials of healing water from the springs have been claimed to heal all kinds of ailments. We should allow our diplomatic corps to make full use of the waters when dealing with foreign nations."

 luc_papal_diplomacy_title: "Papal Diplomacy"
 luc_papal_diplomacy_desc: "Traditionally a Guelph city, we have always enjoyed good relations with the Pope and the fact that the Lucchese Pope Lucius III was also a papal legate engaged in diplomatic affairs has certainly been of help. The circumstances may change, however, and we should carefully ponder how the future may turn out and choose our position accordingly."
 luc_luccan_reinassance_title: "Luccan Renaissance"
 luc_luccan_reinassance_desc: "Although our city is not as prosperous as Florence or Siena, local artists have managed to produce high-quality artwork in our own distinctive style. Supporting this tradition should bring fame to our city."
 luc_university_lucca_title: "The University of Lucca"
 luc_university_lucca_desc: "Although the right to establish an institution of learning was granted in the 14th century by both the Emperor and the Pope, previous attempts to do so have all met with failure. With recent advances in various fields of study, we should establish one soon so that we do not fall behind our neighbours."

 ME_Lucca_Events.1.T: "City of a Hundred Churches"
 ME_Lucca_Events.1.D: "Due to our importance on the Via Francigena, so many pilgrims have stopped in Lucca and so many churches have been built that we are known as the City of a Hundred Churches. Recent decreases in pilgrim arrivals mean that we have less income and some of the churches are falling into disrepair. Fortunately, we have enough funds remaining from the construction of the tempietto for the Holy Face that we can fund repairs for one of our churches. The question remains: which?"
 ME_Lucca_Events.1.OPT1: "San Michele in Foro, built over the ancient Roman forum and seat of the Consiglio Maggiore."
 ME_Lucca_Events.1.OPT2: "San Frediano, dedicated to the Irish bishop and Prince of Ulster."
 ME_Lucca_Events.1.OPT3: "Santi Paolino e Donato, housing the relics of San Paolino."
 ME_Lucca_Events.1.OPT4: "Santi Giovanni e Reparata, original seat of the Lucca diocese."
 ME_Lucca_Events.1.OPT5: "San Pietro Somaldi, with the fresco of St. Peter gaining keys."
 ME_Lucca_Events.1.OPT6: "San Giusto, I like how it looks."

 ME_Lucca_Events.2.T: "Spring Water Diplomacy"
 ME_Lucca_Events.2.D: "Water from the springs is cheap, but it still costs money to have it collected and transported to a faraway court, all the while being careful that the heavy containers do not leak or break. Maybe we can think of a way to reduce the cost?"
 ME_Lucca_Events.2.OPT1: "No. We must be sincere in giving and bear the full cost."
 ME_Lucca_Events.2.OPT2: "Use smaller vessels with less water and tell the foreigners that less is more."
 ME_Lucca_Events.2.OPT3: "Fill the containers with normal water near the foreign courts."
 ME_Lucca_Events.2.OPT4: "Only send the water to the most powerful courts, and use exclusive gifts of water to provoke jealousy whenever possible."
