 mfa_moscato_title: "Moscato d'Asti"
 mfa_moscato_desc: "Moscato is an aromatic grape from which some of the most important sweet wines in Italy derive, such as Moscato d'Asti. In our wine shop you will find the best Moscato wines, from the Alto Adige Yellow and Rosa to the Pantelleria version, where this vine is called Zibibbo. The name of this wine probably derives from the characteristics of the Muscat grape, which recalls musk and nutmeg: on the nose, in addition to these notes, peach, sage and honey can also be recognized, and on the palate these notes return and is distinguished by its great lightness and drinkability.  Widespread throughout Italy, Moscato is mainly used in Piedmont, in the Moscato Bianco variety."
 mfa_military_campaign_title: "A Military Campaign"
 mfa_military_campaign_desc: "As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round [Root.Monarch.GetName], a curios conversation began. The marshals began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhytm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side."
 mfa_war_lombardy_title: "War in Lombardy"
 mfa_war_lombardy_desc: "As they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of the Golenali forest loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Lombard, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrow sticking in back or throat. At last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. War is coming."
 mfa_fall_visconti_title: "Fall of Visconti"
 mfa_fall_visconti_desc: "Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a Lombard officer's head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears. The last vestiges of the Visconti are no more, the remnants of their armies run shattered in the fields outside the cities seeking for salvation from the horse lord of Mantua."

 mfa_safe_border_title: "Safe Border"
 mfa_safe_border_desc: "This was its fashion, while the city was at his height, accounted by many the chief of Italians. A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. Once entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and filled with avenues and groves of fruitful trees, watered by stream that flowed from the mountains to a lake."
 mfa_ligurian_shores_title: "Ligurian Shores"
 mfa_ligurian_shores_desc: "Darkness flees the rising sun the village lies ahead, it will wake to a new day soon soon they all be dead. We came in cover of moonless night, thousands of man at arms, now at first morning light the church bell sound the alarm."
 mfa_po_valley_title: "The Po Valley"
 mfa_po_valley_desc: "The day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At last they saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Alps. Down the hillside the younglings, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. One the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud."
 mfa_lombardo_veneto_title: "Lombardo Veneto"
 mfa_lombardo_veneto_desc: "It was a deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. Mist of shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings and a murmur like voices passing. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lighting far away across the Valley, Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed."

 mfa_roma_victa_est_desc: "Massive waves consume us all, the ocean is released, our dying world quakes underneath and sinks into the sea. And now nothing will survive! Extinction waits for everyone, for women and men alike, when all are gone of the old world, a new one will arise."
 mfa_first_among_italians_title: "First Among the Italians"

 mfa_resurgence_title: "Resurgence"
 mfa_resurgence_desc: "Time, has come to wash our shame away, to erase the image of defeat. We, have licked our wounds,restored our strength, and our vengeance will be oh so sweet. They thought they had us down, that we'd never rise again, they will learn that they were deadly wrong, what's owed will be repaid. So raise, raise the flag once more, in Italy the eagle will be fed. March, again we march to war, we will march for victory or death. Pain, the pain and suffering, is but a bleak and distant fading dream. Shame, our disgrace; a withering thought, finally our names will be redeemed."
 mfa_rising_power_title: "Rising Power"
 mfa_rising_power_desc: "Since I was born they have kept me down, they have forced me to conform. I will tear down their holy crown in a vengeful thunder storm. I loathe their bloody righteous ways it fills me with despise, fueling flames of violent rage, I will be their world's demise. All this rage, and all this hate, it burns me deep inside, and still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive. Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free, the one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me."

You all shall fall to me! Italy has always been my home, but I'm of different blood. I will overthrow the throne, deceiver of the wars!"
 mfa_conquest_venetia_title: "Conquest of Venetia"
 mfa_conquest_venetia_desc: "The sun was already westering as they rode from Mantova, and the light of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Lombardy to a golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, aid this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the Alps loomed, even darker and taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind."
 mfa_trading_venice_title: "Trading in Venice"
 mfa_trading_venice_desc: "The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the man from the lagoon. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, and still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the canals gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. In the St Mark's square the host of our horses roared like a sea, swarmed about its feet from end to end. Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Mercenaries sprang up them like apes in the dark forest of the South. Before the Cathedral's door the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on."
 mfa_new_empire_title: "A New Empire"
 mfa_new_empire_desc: "Fortune favors just the brave that's what the blessed always say, love will come in time but I'm always late. I pray the wine my will to take and those evil hands to tie, wreaking havoc, baneful sight is growing dim. Tie the dream I've had my fill, raze the love and tie my will, fires ploughing up my head oh forgive I will forget. Lord are you hiding in the haze? The seventh door I'll try is daze. Angel send another storm to face another dawn."

It carries us out to sea, with hope of fame and pride. And glorious all will be, that with sword in hand will die."

 mfa_doors_christianity_desc: "I stroke the blade with my hand the sharp edge cuts the skin, blood drips to the rain wet sand my journey can begin. Once a slave but now I'm free my honour is restored, once again I'll ride the seas free at last from whip and oar. I slide the sword into the sheath the almighty god is hailed, and as we push out to the sea we raise the red striped sails. I've missed the breeze of my home shores the frozen lakes and winter snow, but now my dreams start to unfold... father, I'm coming home!"

 mfa_constantinople_desc: "The storm came down without remorse and water crashed the rails, the ship was thrown back and forth as strong winds ripped the sails.

 mfa_rinascimento_desc: "We know very little about Macrino d’Alba, whose real name was Gian Giacomo De Alladio, we know nothing for sure about his Roman youth, where his pictorial art was formed.

 ME_Montferrat_Events.1.T: "Greek Knowledge"
 ME_Montferrat_Events.1.D: "I myself listened to him in Florence, since he came to the Council together with the Greeks, affirming that the whole world, after a few years, would adhere to one and the same religion, with one soul, one mind, one teaching. And when I asked him: 'That of Christ or of Muhammad'? He replied: 'Neither, but one not different from that of the Gentiles'. I was so scandalized by these words that I always hated him and always feared him like a poisonous viper, and I could no longer bear to see him or hear him. I also learned from some Greeks, who fled the Peloponnese here, that he had publicly stated, some three years before his death, that - not many years after his death - Muhammad and Christ would be forgotten and the actual truth would triumph in every part of the world."

Darkness then descends day turns into night, a massive cloud of thousand arrows fills the misty sky. \n\nWith violent force the two armies crash the battle now begins, cries of war as weapons clash, uncertain who will win. \n\nThunder rolls 'cross the waves, lightning cracks the sky, clouds release hail big as grapes, as arrows are let fly. \n\nHear the soldiers' roar! they call to mighty Lord, the fury in their raging eyes, will burn forever more. Hear the weapons sing! Feel the arrows sting! They climb onto the Capital's walls and begin to fight."

I've spent my life in foolish quests for gold and riches, I confess, and now I'm left with just regrets too late to change my ways. My life, it seems, has slipped away I leave no legacy to praise, nothing more for me to say my life has been a waste."
