 ME_Muscovy_Events.10.t: "The Subjugation of Novgorod"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.10.d: "After sieging down and occupying the city of Novgorod, many think that the war will be over. We could send a diplomat to their leaders with demands: Be annexed and we will end the violence. The people are begging for peace and dying in the streets. The chances of this offer being accepted is high but some military advisors and nobles would like a different offer. Anyhow, victory is ours!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.10.a: "Let us see how much they care about their people..."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.10.b: "We shall make our own version of peace!"
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.11.t: "The Subjugation of Novgorod"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.11.d: "A diplomat has come from the vile Rurikovich hound. He offers to end the violence if we agree to be annexed. While the war has been gruesome and hard for our people, perhaps there is still a chance of victory?"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.11.a: "Let us end this bloodshed."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.11.b: "God shall guide us to revenge!"
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.12.t: "Consolidation of Lands"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.12.d: "Now that we control vast lands north of Moscow, we need to decide how to manage these lands. Many nobles are eager to take control of the various castles and villages but that would allow them to increase their influence. Perhaps the Crown should seize the lands and control it directly? Doing this would infuriate the nobles though..."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.12.a: "Castles for the Nobles!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.12.b: "The Crown shall rule these lands."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.12.tta: "Gain §R2.00§! unrest in §YEvery Owned Province§! without core of §Y[From.GetName]§!.\n"

 ME_Muscovy_Events.13.t: "The Governing of Novgorod"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.13.d: "Some Nobles from the former republic have come to us with a plea. They ask to reconsider our decision about the former Republican lands. They say that the citizens are treated poorly and unequally. They suggest that we give some concessions to improve the situation. While this would be beneficial some of our advisors say that cracking down on such traitorous talk should be our priority."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.13.a: "Crack down on the separatists."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.13.b: "Grant some concessions."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.13.c: "The situation works for now."

 ME_Muscovy_Events.20.t: "A Deal from Moscow"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.20.d: "An emisary from the Kniaz in Moskva has come to our court this morning. He brings gifts and an offer. The Kniaz offers us protection against our Mongol neighbours. In return we would become a Vassal but with more liberty than usual. The offer sounds interesting but perhaps it is better to make our own history?"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.20.a: "We shall accept their protection."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.20.b: "We can handle our own!"
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.40.t: "Smolensk Artillery Fields"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.40.d: "Smolensk is worldwide known for it's usage of Artillery. Whoever controlled the city, could field large amounts of high quality Artillery. Now that is in our control, we have been confronted with a decision. We could specialize in destroying the thickest walls there is or make it so we rain hell upon our enemies. A third option is that we just create vassals out of the territory and have them specialise and supply us with Artillery. Either way, our enemies shall fear our cannons."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.40.a: "Our shells will block the sun!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.40.b: "Tear down their walls!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.40.c: "They will serve under our banner."
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.50.t: "The Powerful on their Knees"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.50.d: "The Boyars, a group of rich and influential people capable of curbing the power of the Crown. They've betrayed us, lied to us, and insulted us for centuries. If we want to rule efficiently and justly, then it is necessary to seize their lands and strike fear in their hearts. They shall be reminded about who sits the Throne!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.50.a: "Execute order 66..."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.50.b: "Why risk another civil war?"
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.60.t: "Zemsky Sobor"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.60.d: "While we grow as a nation, so does our administration grow. We have gotten many petitions from the peasantry and nobility with, of course, different interests. Many see that it is time to combine all our laws and change some of them in this new age of our nation. The only problem is that it will be hard to not favor a certain group. One thing is certain: This could become a double-edged blade."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.60.a: "Nothing to lose, but our chains."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.60.b: "Compromise is the art of politics."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.60.c: "The Nobility leads, the peasants follow."
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.70.t: "Shemyaka's Rebellion"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.70.d: "When Vasily II ascended the throne, many saw him as weak and illegitimate. The various unloyal Nobles supported his uncle Dmitry Shemyaka in his attempt to secure the Throne. Dmitry knew he could not defeat Vasiliy on his own and allied with different Khans many times until he was forced to sign a truce. Now, seeing the fragile state Vasily is in, Dmitry decides to bid his chance on the Throne. But the struggle will be harsh: Many Rurikovich vassals would rather have an incompetent liege than a capable one and thus have supported Vasily since the start of the conflict."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.70.a: "The throne belongs to Vasiliy!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.70.b: "We bend the knee to the Horde!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.70.tta: "§YEvery Subject Country§! with dynasty §YRurikovich§! declares war with §YIndependence War§! casus belli\n"
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.71.t: "Muscovite Civil War"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.71.d: "Our new Tributary is having a civil war, caused by the sudden change of rule. The current Kniaz pleads us to send some of our horse riders to quell this rebellion. While keeping our newfound tributary would be beneficial, some argue we should use our resources elsewhere. This would of course result in having an unloyal subject and potential enemy on our borders."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.71.a: "The Khan giveth..."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.71.b: "...and the Khan taketh."
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.80.t: "A Woman of Purple"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.80.d: "A woman, claiming to be a close relative of last Basileus, has come to our capital. She asks us for protection from the vile Turks and residence in Moskva. An opportunity showed itself though, we could decide to marry this woman. Doing this could result in increasing our prestige and religious importance and in the future make us have certain claims."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.80.a: "Rome lives on."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.80.b: "We shall not walk in the shadows of others."
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.90.t: "An Emissary from Beyond the Caucasus"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.90.d: "We have discovered that we are not the only ones who despise the Turks. Far in the north is a heathen kingdom who is quite powerful. We could perhaps ally this nation and target our rival. This way we would have a chance of defeating them once and for all. Some of our mystics protest however claiming that Allah will give us victory instead of a heathen nation."
 ME_Muscovy_Events.90.a: "Request an honorable alliance!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.90.b: "We need no help from heathens!"
 
 ME_Muscovy_Events.91.t: "A Message from the Rus"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.91.d: "A strange man has come from a far away land called Persia. He says that he is a diplomat with an offer from the local ruler. The offer would contain an alliance aimed at taking out the Turks. It is known that we would benefit from their demise but is it worth a heathen ally?"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.91.a: "We gladly accept!"
 ME_Muscovy_Events.91.b: "We shall do it ourselves!"
