  persia_other_religions_desc: "The persians are thought to have worshipped deities of the natural world: Water, Fire, Earth and above all else the Sky, their foremost deity being Ahuramazda, depicted as a winged guardian.

  persia_faith_leadership_desc: "The great lord of two seas and two parts of the world, a title that Mohammed gave himself after the capture of Constantinople, not satisfied with new conquests, aimed to extend the borders of his empire to the detriment of his neighboring princes. Among these, the most powerful were on the side of Europe: Venice, which offered civilization the wall of its estates in the east; on the side of Asia, the new Persian monarch. Venice and Persia therefore had to come to an agreement against the common natural enemy, since Providence mainly destined these two states to curb his ambition in the West and in the East."

  persia_protecting_levant_trade_desc: "The Levant is home to a myriad of cultures and peoples. Not to mention one of the most important holy cities to all the Abrahamic Faiths.

  persia_iran_bozorg_desc: "From the Achaemenid Empire, which at its height contained half of the glob's population by some counts, to the mighty militaristic Safavid Dynasty, good governance has long been the core of the success of successive Persian states. Those, like the tyrannical Timurids, who failed to adopt such practices were doomed to failure. The systems of regional governance, checks and balances, professional career bureaucracy and ministers, and meritocratic recruitment rivalled even the legendary governments of the Great Celestial Empire and Byzantium, and were far ahead of their time in developing a “modern state“."

  persia_overlooking_indus_desc: "A great number of tributaries to the Ganges criss cross our country. Rivers such as the Kosi, Gandak, Mahananda or Bagmati water our lands and provide transportation for our merchants. At times, however, they are also a great hindrance. Great rains can sometimes flood large areas of our state, spreading disease, destroying roads and harming our crops. As natives of these lands this is something we have grown used to handling. An invader on the other hand could easily find himself in a much harsher situation."
  persia_reclaiming_khorasan_title: "Reclaiming Khorasan"
  persia_reclaiming_khorasan_desc: "With large deserts, high mountains and large tribal communities, Khorasan might seem like an inhospitable place.

  persia_into_india_title: "Into India"
  persia_into_india_desc: "Throughout the centuries Tirhut has been a crossroad for traders.

  persia_persian_beauty_title: "Persian Beauty"
  persia_persian_beauty_desc: "Just as we bring destruction to our enemies we must bring peace to the many who reside within our borders.

  persia_king_sun_desc: "Like the light of the Sun itself, the glory of Persia shines as a beacon to the rest of the world for what an Empire can be, and what an Emperor should be. Let us be that light, and like the sun, let our Emperor light the way out of the darkness for the whole of the earth."

  persia_indian_dominance_title: "Indian Dominance"
  persia_indian_dominance_desc: "Across the Thar Desert lays India - the land divided by different cultures, religions and landscape, always busy with their petty squabbles and fight for fleeting superiority.

During his reign, the importance of infantry began to be realised in Persian Armies, whereas they previously were second to the cavalry. Jazayerchi units engaged in training several hours every day. A clear emphasis was given to constant drilling of the soldiers. Nader shaped the jazayerchi corps himself and often took personal command of them in battle. According to another contemporary, the jazayerchi were well uniformed and provided with the best equipment. Although the Jazayerchi were an infantry corps they usually campaigned on mounts and occasionally fought as mounted troops also. They were used to achieve the hardest and most crucial tactical tasks due to their high quality as elite fighting troops, proving their worth in many battles including Mihmandust, Murche-Khort, Kirkuk, Yeghevard, Karnal and Kars."

Unlike European muskets however, the jazayer was loaded using a horn rather than a paper cartridge meaning although the jazayer had the advantages of range, force of impact and accuracy, it took longer to reload than the standard European muskets of the era. One of the earliest recordings of Persian soldiers using jazayers in combat dates back to the mid-seventeenth century."

Caravanserais were designed especially to benefit poorer travelers, as they could stay there for as long as they wished, without payment for lodging. During the reign of Shah Abbas I, as he tried to upgrade the Silk Road to improve the commercial prosperity of the Empire, an abundance of caravanserais, bridges, bazaars and roads were built, and this strategy was followed by wealthy merchants who also profited from the increase in trade.

The qollar-aghasi, the qurchi-bashi, and the tofangchi-aghasi were notable members of the military branch, yet the focus of administration was centered around checks and balances. The highest level in the government was that of the Prime Minister, or Grand Vizier (Etemad-e Dowlat), who was always chosen from among doctors of law. He enjoyed tremendous power and control over national affairs as he was the immediate deputy of the Shah. No act of the Shah was valid without the counter seal of the Prime Minister. But even he stood accountable to a deputy, who kept records of his decision-makings and notified the Shah. Second to the Prime Minister post were the General of the Revenues (mostoufi-ye mamalek), or finance minister, and the Divanbegi, Minister of Justice. In 16th and 17th century Iran, there existed a considerable number of local democratic institutions. Examples of such were the trade and artisan guilds, which had started to appear in Iran from the 1500s. Also, there were the quazi-religious fraternities called futuvva, which were run by local dervishes. Another official selected by the consensus of the local community was the kadkhoda, who functioned as a common law administrator."

Persian carpets and rugs were initially woven as articles of necessity to cover the floors of nomadic tribesmen, giving them protection from the cold and damp. The natural progression of the skill and craft involved in the creation of these works of art has been passed down from generation to generation over the centuries throughout periods of peace, invasion and war. As international trade developed, the variety of patterns and designs grew. The Persian carpet reached its zenith during the reign of the Safavid Dynasty, where Shah Abbas encouraged contacts and trade with Europe and transformed his new capital, Isfahan, into one of the most glorious cities of Persia. He also built workshops for carpets where skilled designers and craftsmen set to work to create splendid specimens.
