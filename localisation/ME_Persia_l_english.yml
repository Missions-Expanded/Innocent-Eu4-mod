The importance of both these people, and the Zagros mountains cannot be overstated. They are the Gate Keepers to the Heartland of Persia. If they fall, all of Persia will fall. We must ensure that those mountains, and their keepers are always protected, both politically and militarily."

From Hellens in the West, to Indians in the East; Egyptians in the South, and Scythians in the North, all live under the banner of Persia, of Eranshahr.

By giving them over to local rulers of the Ghulams, we can ensure peace and prosperity within the region, while allowing local customs and traditions to be protected. Of course this will demand that we give the Ghulams some voice in court, but easy enough to do. Just keep them in check, and make sure they know who the Shah is."

  persia_shia_militants_desc: "Afsharid infantry was split into two armies. The Tofangchi was the regular corps of musketeers, while the Jazayerchi were the elite gunners of Nader's personal army. During his reign, the importance of infantry began to be realised in Persian Armies, whereas they previously were second to the cavalry. Jazayerchi units engaged in training several hours every day. A clear emphasis was given to constant drilling of the soldiers. Nader shaped the jazayerchi corps himself and often took personal command of them in battle. According to another contemporary, the jazayerchi were well uniformed and provided with the best equipment. Although the Jazayerchi were an infantry corps they usually campaigned on mounts and occasionally fought as mounted troops also. They were used to achieve the hardest and most crucial tactical tasks due to their high quality as elite fighting troops, proving their worth in many battles including Mihmandust, Murche-Khort, Kirkuk, Yeghevard, Karnal and Kars."

  persia_tupchi_tofangchi_desc: "The Jazayer, a flintlock musket, used by these infantrymen was of a much heavier calibre than their European counterparts and consequently had a greater range as well as improved accuracy. Unlike European muskets however, the jazayer was loaded using a horn rather than a paper cartridge meaning although the jazayer had the advantages of range, force of impact and accuracy, it took longer to reload than the standard European muskets of the era. One of the earliest recordings of Persian soldiers using jazayers in combat dates back to the mid-seventeenth century."

The size of this cavalry body fluctuated with time but at one point it was reported as 70,000 strong. Elements within the Savaran-e Sepah-e Khorasan were occasionally promoted by Nader to the Savaran-e Saltanati."

Iranian caravanserais were better built and cleaner than their Turkish counterparts. Caravanserais were designed especially to benefit poorer travelers, as they could stay there for as long as they wished, without payment for lodging. During the reign of Shah Abbas I, as he tried to upgrade the Silk Road to improve the commercial prosperity of the Empire, an abundance of caravanserais, bridges, bazaars and roads were built, and this strategy was followed by wealthy merchants who also profited from the increase in trade. To uphold the standard, another source of revenue was needed, and road toll, that were collected by guards (rah-dars), were stationed along the trading routes."

The highest level in the government was that of the Prime Minister, or Grand Vizier (Etemad-e Dowlat), who was always chosen from among doctors of law. He enjoyed tremendous power and control over national affairs as he was the immediate deputy of the Shah. No act of the Shah was valid without the counter seal of the Prime Minister. But even he stood accountable to a deputy, who kept records of his decision-makings and notified the Shah. Second to the Prime Minister post were the General of the Revenues (mostoufi-ye mamalek), or finance minister, and the Divanbegi, Minister of Justice. n 16th and 17th century Iran, there existed a considerable number of local democratic institutions. Examples of such were the trade and artisan guilds, which had started to appear in Iran from the 1500s. Also, there were the quazi-religious fraternities called futuvva, which were run by local dervishes.

As international trade developed, the variety of patterns and designs grew. The Persian carpet reached its zenith during the reign of the Safavid Dynasty, where Shah Abbas encouraged contacts and trade with Europe and transformed his new capital, Isfahan, into one of the most glorious cities of Persia. He also built workshops for carpets where skilled designers and craftsmen set to work to create splendid specimens. Most of these carpets were made of silk, with gold and silver threads adding even more embellishment."

  desc_persia_kurdish_fighter: "Even if we are used to nomadize in the plains, we are never far from our dear mountains. There we always find a refuge, and there we fight the hardest in time of war. As far back as we remember, never an invader crossed our lands without repenting."
  persia_fourth_force: "The Fourth Force"
  desc_persia_fourth_force: "The Caucasus mountains have always been a huge natural barrier dominating the landscape for hundreds of miles. On the northern side hills slowly descend into the endless sea of grass known as the Steppe, and on the southern side countless rivers cut valleys through the highlands that descend into the rich lands of Persia. The rumors of these endless riches have always attracted the peoples of the Steppe and many of them cross the Caucasian mountains to reach them."

  desc_persia_expanded_ghulam: "Previously our army has been heavily dependent on Feudal levies (Qizilbash) who have proved to be more to loyal themselves than the throne. We will found a standing army of professional infantry and cavalry, whose loyalty is to the Shah first, to defend the country."

  desc_persia_qizilbash_shiite: "From the mountainous regions of azerbaijan, the Shiite Safavid militant order of the Qizilbash contributed to the founding of Persia itself. Initially formed from the Safaviyya Sufi order headed by Shayk Haydar, the group rose to prominensce from its connections with other secret societies like the Khurramites and Turko-Shamanism. From then, it expanded greatly among the Turks and Tajiks, helping Shah Ismail I conquer the Aq Qoyunlu tribe across the Tigris and Eastern Persia. For the most part, their loyalty and militarism established a strong Shiite state that, while intolerant of most other Muslims, carved out and independent Persia that survived both Colonialism and Revolution."

  desc_persia_gunpowder_empires_zoroastrian: "The Jazayer, a flintlock musket, used by these infantrymen was of a much heavier calibre than their European counterparts and consequently had a greater range as well as improved accuracy. Unlike European muskets however, the jazayer was loaded using a horn rather than a paper cartridge meaning although the jazayer had the advantages of range, force of impact and accuracy, it took longer to reload than the standard European muskets of the era. One of the earliest recordings of Persian soldiers using jazayers in combat dates back to the mid-seventeenth century."

Extremely fertile and densely populated this region is the source of a large portion of the manufactured goods of the subcontinent. The many trade routes that criss-cross the region then in turn take these goods to the faraway places that demand them, from Persia to China and eventually even to Europe."

 persia_grateful_army: "Grateful Army"
 desc_persia_grateful_army: "Tribal loyalties are strong in our lands and in many ways trying to supplant these by loyalty to our state can be a futile exercise. Instead of trying to create an army like that of our Indian or Persian neighbors let us work with the system we have. Each major tribe should be made accountable to create and maintain an army to our standards and to pay for the expeditions we order. In return we will strengthen their authority over the minor tribes under their control."
 persia_reintroducion_elephants: "Reintroduction of the Elephants"
 desc_persia_reintroducion_elephants: "Already in the ancient times the Persian military deployed Indian elephants in siege warfare and, more infrequently, in set piece engagements where the beasts had a psychological impact on enemies not accustomed to facing them. Elephants were otherwise used for pioneering/engineering duties and, presumably, for general logistics tasks."
 persia_elephant_barracks: "Elephant Barracks"
 desc_persia_elephant_barracks: "Persian war elephants were trained by their rider, called a mahout, who would also ride the elephant into battle. The mahouts were of Indian origin, and so were the archers. Training elephants was a difficult and they would be hard to maintain because they ate so much food and water. On the march, huge paths needed to be cut for the elephants. Many were kept in the shah's menagerie the most famous of which was Khosrau II where he kept a "thousand white elephants."
