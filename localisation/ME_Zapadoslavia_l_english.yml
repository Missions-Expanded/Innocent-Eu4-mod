 ZCV_ideas_start: "West Slavic Traditions"
 ZCV_ideas_bonus: "West Slavic Ambition"
 
 bohemia_hussite_legacy_freerdom_of_religion: "Hussite Legacy"
 bohemia_hussite_legacy_freerdom_of_religion_desc: "When the Hussites were around, Bohemia was perhaps at its greatest and most unique amongst the corrupt influences of the Catholic Church and its papacy. Though they were defeated after several attempts by the abhorrent Catholics, the Hussites edged out a somewhat favorable deal that guaranteed freedom of religion in Bohemia and we will take that to heart in our greater realm."

 bohemia_innovate_on_military_technology: "Innovative Military Measures"
 bohemia_innovate_on_military_technology_desc: "As the Catholics came after us in wave after wave, we took it upon ourselves to innovate and use new gunpowder weapons against our foes to great effect. Let us continue this tradition of military innovation both on and off the fields of war and refine our military so that we are always a cut above the rest in terms of military strength."

 slovak_development_of_the_terrain: "Development of the Terrain"
 slovak_development_of_the_terrain_desc: "Both fertile and harsh terrain are present throughout Zapadoslavia, but cultivation of both is needed for prosperity and strength. We must invest time and effort into developing the land for both agriculture and mining so that every aspect of Zapadoslavia is running properly and without issue, whether it be the military or the administration."
 
 moravia_first_and_foremost_of_the_west_slavs: "The Moravians"
 moravia_first_and_foremost_of_the_west_slavs_desc: "The Moravians are known as the first people to create an independent West Slavic polity that gained legitimacy in the eyes of foreign powers. With them integrated inside Zapadoslavia, their legitimacy flows throughout the wider realm of Zapadoslavia and the people know this full well. The history of Great Moravia is intertwined with us and we will embrace this glorious part of our history."

 polska_jageillonian_university: "Jagiellonian University"
 polska_jageillonian_university_desc: "Being one of the oldest universities in Europe, Jageillonian University in the lands of the Poles has been and will continue to serve as a bastion of knowledge and innovation for all of Zapadoslavia. Our investment into it and preservation of it over time will help ensure a great future for not only the Polish people, but all the people within Zapadoslavia as it will be an example to follow when we build future universities."

 polska_dynastic_ties: "The Nature of Dynasties"
 polska_dynastic_ties_desc: "Dynastic politics can get very messy and we know this all too well. The dynastic ties of the Polish, for example, are far reaching great in number, meaning that if we play the political and diplomatic game correctly, we can coerce and influence our neighbors to be more in our favor. It's not shady business, it's just the nature of things as we know them."

 the_greatness_of_zachoslavia: "The Greatness of Zapadoslavia"
 the_greatness_of_zachoslavia_desc: "Zapadoslavia is truly a sight to behold and it's grandeur will only increase as time goes on. As the borders expand, the administration expands, and so does the military, meaning that more of the scattered Slavic people will come into our domain and find solace in being with their Slavic brothers and sisters. It will take time to make this so, but Zapadoslavia will be the one to make it a reality."

 ME_Zapadoslavia_Events.1.d: "Whilst the West Slavs have been united in name, there is still disunity between them. The fraction between them is a big internal issue that must be resolved quickly.
