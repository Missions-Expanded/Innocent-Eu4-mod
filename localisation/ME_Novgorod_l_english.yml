 nov_orthodox_principalities_desc: "Time, has come to wash our shame away, to erase the image of defeat. We, have licked our wounds,restored our strength, and our vengeance will be oh so sweet. They thought they had us down, that we'd never rise again, they will learn that they were deadly wrong, what's owed will be repaid. So raise, raise the flag once more, between the Rus the bear will be fed. March, again we march to war, we will march for victory or death. Pain, the pain and suffering, is but a bleak and distant fading dream. Shame, our disgrace; a withering thought, finally our names will be redeemed."
 nov_dethroning_velikiy_knyaz_title: "Dethroning Velikiy Knyaz"
 nov_dethroning_velikiy_knyaz_desc: "Since I was born they have kept me down, they have forced me to conform. I will tear down their holy crown in a vengeful thunder storm. I loathe their bloody righteous ways it fills me with despise, fueling flames of violent rage, I will be their world's demise. All this rage, and all this hate, it burns me deep inside, and still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive. Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free, the one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me."

 nov_velikaya_respublika_desc: "We, the industrious people of the Grand Republic of Novgorod, have come out on top. No other principality, duchy or kingdom can claim to rival our immense glory, wealth and power - not in our corner of the world, certainly not. Tver - conquered! Ryazan - conquered, and the arrogant Muscovy - gone! Indeed, for after decades of struggle, the whole of Russia has been united. Never more should the peasants face such barbaric tyranny as seen in antiquated likes of Muscovy, Ryazan, Tver, and countless others. Never, never again will Russian blood be spilt in the name of petty dynastic quarrels. Never, never again will foreigners encroach on our fair land. No, for now is the time for prosperity and wealth - we shall blossom and bloom like flowers in spring."

 nov_frozen_republic_title: "The Frozen Republic"
 nov_frozen_republic_desc: "For many decades Novgorod now we have faced threats coming from our southwest and our southeast. The Poles and Lithuanians seek to take over the Baltic whilst Moscow seeks to end Novgorod altogether, and yet we still stand here, ready to defend our state and our principles and what territory that we have fought for in previous centuries. The time is now for us to expand our military arsenal for the coming years of war since we know very well that our traditional rivals are not going to stop fighting against us until they are firmly dead."
 nov_komi_title: "The Komi"
 nov_komi_desc: "Forests and rivers are what dominate the landscape of the Komi. Our state has scattered villages and towns of course, but none can deny that if fights take place in our land, it is among the forests and woods and by the rivers and creeks. If commanders and soldiers don't know how to navigate these lands, they will die by those that do, and just who exactly are the masters of this kind of warfare? The Komi people of course."
 nov_monomakh_cap_title: "Monomakh's Cap"

 nov_natsiya_morehodov_title: "Natsiya Morehodov"
 nov_natsiya_morehodov_desc: "An old man by a seashore at the end of day gazes the horizon with seawinds in his face, tempest-tossed island, seasons all the same anchorage unpainted and a ship without a name. Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard he lightens the beacon, light at the end of world, showing the way, lighting hope in their hearts the ones on their travels homeward from afar."
 nov_morskiye_bazy_title: "Morskiye Bazy"
 nov_morskiye_bazy_desc: "Our access to the sea, plentiful it may be, is nonetheless severely hampered by our lack of any modern infrastructure (and perhaps the rather unfortunate fact that it is frozen for half the year) - indeed, for how can we even pretend to be a major force to be reckoned with, when we barely have any docks, harbours, marketplaces and so forth? Perhaps, the time has come to alleviate that particular problem. I, /current title + name of ruler/, hereby decree that ten shipyards shall be constructed in shortest order! Surely, men and business will come a-flocking to the newly prospering coastline!"

 nov_cut_title: "The Cut"
 nov_cut_desc: "Whilst the people of Novgorod participated in economic matters such as catching fish for food, obtaining salt for a number of matters, and growing crops like flax and hops, what has been the life-blood of Novgorod since its inception has been the fur trade."
 nov_kalmar_union_title: "Kalmar Union"
 nov_kalmar_union_desc: "The Kalmar Union that was instituted by the great Margaret I of Denmark has had its rough spots, certainly, but it is not without its lasting legacy on the land. The lands of Scandinavia have been disunited for several decades before our time, but we must have the strength and the will to see to it that the region is united!"
 nov_northern_wane_title: "Northern Wane"
 nov_northern_wane_desc: "A thick fog lies ahead, the ocean's deadly calm, the ship glides on the silent waves, into the unknown. We cannot turn around, for us it's much too late, we puts our back into the oar, and rows towards our fate. \nThe ship cuts through the milk white mist, through the blind they clearly hear, the oar strokes of our mighty fleet, battle's drawing near. Our heart pounds loud and wild, we've waited for this day, then suddenly a turkey's head appears out of the haze."

 nov_urals_title: "Mining the Mountains"
 nov_urals_desc: "The Urals, mighty mountains they are, are fabulously rich in minerals, precious stones and valuable metals. Iron, various metals of varying hardness and rarity, are all present here. However, these resources are to be found in other mountains and mines - they are nothing unique to the Urals. Nay, for no ordinary mountains harbours as much gold as this one; no other mountain has in store so much copper. Our industry shall struggle no more, neither will our nobles lack in gemstones and diamonds. Most importantly, our coffers will now be full to the brim!"

 nov_severniy_poluostrov_title: "Severniy Poluostrov"
 nov_severniy_poluostrov_desc: "Denmark, Sweden, and the Hanseatic League will still be thorns in the side of Novgorod's trade sector, but the more time we dedicate to building trade ships and establishing trade relations, the more influence we will obtain over time."
 nov_pomor_trade_title: "Pomor Trade"
 nov_pomor_trade_desc: "Far up north, on the wide shores of the Arctic, an unlikely trade route has started forming. On these shores, it is a fact that life is oft rather hard and lacking in various amenities. Therefore, one has to improvise, to adapt - such as the brilliant fishermen and farmers of the Pomor have done; trading in flour and fish. The Norwegians, tough folk they are, have fish aplenty yet no bread nor flour to speak off. On the other hand, our farmers have not found themselves lacking in flour, but fish is scarce. We should seek to help establish better connections with the Norwegians, developing and cultivating our marketplaces to better accommodate them - perhaps our coffers will be a little heavier by the end of the ordeal."

 nov_zakat_krestonoscev_desc: "The storm came down without remorse and water crashed the rails, the ship was thrown back and forth as strong winds ripped the sails. The icy waves embrace my skin I am going numb, the endless ocean swallows me this will be my cold wet tomb. Won't feel the breeze of my home shore nor see the lakes or winter snow, my hopeful dreams lie ripped and torn... father, I die alone!"
 nov_baltiyskiy_port_title: "Baltiyskiy Port"
 nov_baltiyskiy_port_desc: "The warming sun returns again, and melts away the snow. The sea is freed from icy chains, winter is letting go. Standing on the ocean side, we can hear the waves. Calling us out with tide, to sail into our fate. Our ships await us by the shore, time has come to leave. Our country, family and homes, for riches in the east. It carries us out to sea, with hope of fame and pride. And glorious all will be, that with sword in hand will die."
 nov_ob_river_title: "The Ob River"
 nov_ob_river_desc: "Ships were prepared, weapons and shields, sails were raised, we headed out to sea! Home disappeared in the west, our journey had begun, helpeful winds gave us our speed, under a warming sun."
