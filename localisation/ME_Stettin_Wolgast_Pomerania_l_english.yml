 ## Stettin
 STE_reclaim_uckermark_title: "Reclaim Borderlands"
 STE_reclaim_uckermark_desc: "The never-ending conflict between the Pomeranian Dukes and the [BRA.GetAdjective] margraves has resulted in many wars and uncountable amounts of lives lost. Despite these shocking statistics, it seems that the conflict is nowhere near being concluded. As such, for yet another time, we must go to war in order to reclaim what's lost."
 STE_build_marketplace_title: "Hanseatic Ties"
 STE_build_marketplace_desc: "[1858.GetName] is not just the residence of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] but also an integral part of the Hanseatic Confederation - an organization of cities which aims to let its members forever prosper. In fact, it is not just [1858.GetName], most of the relevant cities within our realm are. As such, our ties to the Hansa are undeniable and we should tend those relations."
 STE_stettin_stargard_war_title: "Wheat War"
 STE_stettin_stargard_war_desc: "In 1454, the mutual violation of the conflicting privileges granted to the cities of Stettin and Stargard lead to a military conflict between the two cities. It would be dubbed the 'Wheat War' as the conflicting privileges mandated the wheat trade conducted in the Stettin Lagoon. The cities would wage an open diplomatic war by appealing to the pomeranian rulers. The Hanseatic League was invited to help mediate the conflict and to put an end to the war. It was on a Hanseatic Trial that the conflict ended in 1464."

 ## Wolgast
 WOL_support_the_mercantile_cities_title: "Hanseatic Guilds"
 WOL_support_the_mercantile_cities_desc: "Anklam, Greifswald, [2994.GetName], [47.GetName], these are the most important cities in our realm, yet they all have very strong ties to the Hanseatic League - most certainly the most important trade organization in the area. While we could try to weaken the influence of these institutions, why don't we support them instead? Such can only result in more money flowing to the treasury."
 WOL_golden_priveleges_title: "The Golden Privileges"
 WOL_golden_priveleges_desc: "To help win over the support of the hanseatic cities within his realm, Duke Warcislaw IX of Wolgast-Pomerania has granted the cities of Stralsund, Greifswald, Demmin and Anklam the so-called 'Golden Privileges'. The concessions were far-reaching and made the cities very powerful and autonomous. Among the most important privileges were the freedom from paying taxes, the right to make alliances with each other, the rights of land acquisition by the cities and guaranteed jurisdiction against their own city dwellers."
 
 ## Rugen
 RUG_insel_der_wohlstands_title: "Insel des Wohlstands"
 RUG_insel_der_wohlstands_desc: "All [4745.GetName] is famous for are its notorious ties with Baltic Piracy. It doesn't have to be this way, [4745.GetName] deserves acclaim, not condemnation. Let us establish [4745.GetName] as a place where people can look for opportunity in their lives, even if that means reinforcing the privateer ideals."
 RUG_rugen_naval_base_title: "Rügen Naval Base"
 RUG_rugen_naval_base_desc: "[4745.GetName] is the island upon which our state is based. The sound that is located between the isle and the mainland is formed perfectly to support a naval base from which we can launch devastating raids upon enemy bases or flotillas."
 
 ## Generic:
 POM_den_korps_pommerns_title: "Die Korps Pommerns"
 POM_den_korps_pommerns_desc: "The pomeranian lords are in near-perpetual warfare against the [BRA.GetAdjective] Margraves. These fiends shall never subjugate us! And to guarantee that, a new force shall be formed that will not only fend off the Saxon Menace from the south, but will also help bring Pomeranians together once and for all."
 POM_unite_pomerania_title: "Family United"
 POM_unite_pomerania_desc: "Pomerania is split among many subbranches of the Gryf Dynasty. These subbranches come and go, as realms get split among the offspring, while other lines die out and unite. It sounds chaotic, and it truly is. Fortunately, after the many decades, nay, centuries, Pomerania is finally united by the one and only [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 POM_seek_marriages_title: "Strategic Marriages"
 POM_seek_marriages_desc: "The Pomeranian Land is but a pile of sand, divided among many lords and their vassals. This division is perhaps its greatest weak point. The only way we can survive is to use the perfected strategy of marriages. No effort is to be spared while negotiating marriages with our neighbors, if we do not conduct sufficient diplomacy, the splintered states in Pomerania will fall victim to the hands of our greedy neighbors."
 POM_duke_of_pomerania_title: "Princeps Imperii"
 POM_duke_of_pomerania_desc: "Boguslaw the Great, while on his way to Venice from which he aimed to sail for the holy land, had decided to stop by and to meet the German King in person with whom he lead negotiations. He aimed to sway his sovereign into granting him the title of Princeps Imperii - a Prince of the Empire. Such rank would grant him stronger control over his domain, and would diminish the claims of the Brandenburg electorate, which wanted to subjugate the Pomeranian Duchy for the past centuries."
 POM_emperor_support_title: "Imperial Mandate"
 POM_emperor_support_desc: "Duke Boguslaw the Great, perhaps the greatest ruler to ever rule Pomerania, placed diplomacy among his priorities. In his diplomacy, he tried to get the support of the Emperor to affirm the position of Pomerania in the North Germany and to repel the [BRA.GetAdjective] which was waiting for the perfect opportunity to subjugate Pomerania. To say he wasn't successful would be to lie, for under his reign, Pomerania enjoyed decades of peace and prosperity that haven't been seen in centuries."
 POM_capture_rostock_title: "The Western Cities"
 POM_capture_rostock_desc: "Our Mecklenburgian neighbors are very much alike to us. Hanseatic ties, maritime culture, similar customs are but a few characteristics we share. For this reason, maybe integrating them into our state, peaceful or not, could bring prosperity to both the Mecklenburgians and us?"


 ## Formable Pomerania:
 POM_seek_greatest_minds_title: "Seek Great Minds"
 POM_seek_greatest_minds_desc: "Boguslaw the Great, the ruler of unified Pomerania, had embarked on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1496. On his way back, the Duke paid a visit to the Pope, who granted him the occupation right to the Cammin Bishopric among other benefits. Moreover, Boguslaw sought great minds in Italy, and had found lawyers that he brought to Pomerania, Petrus von Ravenna and Johannes von Kitscher, the former having later become a rector in the University of Greifswald."
 POM_greifswald_university_title: "Academia Gryphica"
 POM_greifswald_university_desc: "In 1456, Pope Callixtus the Third, leader of the Catholic Church, has enacted a bull that brought the Greifswald University to life. That success can be attributed to the great dedication of Heinrich Rugenow, mayor of Greifswald, and the efforts of Warcislaw the Ninth, the at-the-time Duke of Wolgast-Pomerania. Thanks to the ties the city had with the Hanseatic League, the University managed to bring together many great minds not just from Northern Germany, but also from Scandinavia. The institution is one of the oldest of its kind in Germany, having been founded only after a handful of other universities."
 POM_subdue_the_league_title: "Subdue the League"
 POM_subdue_the_league_desc: "The Hanseatic League has certainly been a great benefit to our commerce. Despite that, the ever-growing influence on our cities caused by the politics happening in [45.GetName] has begun to hinder our centralization efforts. As such, the Hanseatic League ought to continue operating, just under a different management, one that would not meddle in our internal affairs."
 POM_pomeranian_reformation_title: "Treptower Landtag"
 POM_pomeranian_reformation_desc: "The inner crisis of the Catholic Church, the growing humanism of the University of Greifswald rectors and the unrest amongst the population willing to listen to Martin Luther has put the status of Pomeranian Official Religion to a debate. That has lead to the Landtag in Treptow, a meeting that would decide the future of the Pomeranian Duchy. The Landtag took place in December of 1534 and estates of the realm were called in to participate. In favor of embracing protestantism were the burghers, which were at odds with the clergy, and the rulers of Pomerania, who saw the protestant reformation as an opportunity to secularize and thus seize the lands of bishops and monasteries. On the opposing side were the nobles and the clergy, both of which preferred Pomerania stayed in unity with rome. The opposition was lead by the Bishop of Cammin, Erasmus von Manteuffel-Arnhausen. Despite the fierce resistance, the dukes of Pomerania adopted Protestantism and publicly announced their conversion. This marked the beginning of the creation of Pomeranian Evangelical Church."
 POM_vengeance_title: "The Menacing Gryph"
 POM_vengeance_desc: "Owing to excellent leadership, Pomerania has ultimately united. Now, it is time to take vengeance for the treachery the [BRA.GetAdjective] Margraves had the gall to inflict upon us. Brandenburgians shall tremble in fear, for the Pomeranians are on their way to deliver a fatal blow to their suzerainty. No more will these accursed foes hurt us!"
 POM_silesia_title: "Slavic Ties"
 POM_silesia_desc: "While the language that is predominantly spoken in Pomerania is indoubtedly German, there still are the remains of our slavic heritage. In fact, Pomerania is not the only area to have suffered such fate, for most of the Eastern Germany has been germanized. One of the regions that is on their way to conversion is Silesia, an area that is highly contested between the Czech and Polish realms. Perhaps now is the time for a mediator to come and to solve the conflict? After all, Silesia is suffering the fate of the same ilk."
 POM_prussian_glory_title: "Prussian Ascendance"
 POM_prussian_glory_desc: "The influences of the prussians are growing upon us. With each consecutive day, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the future of the country lies, not just in Pomerania, but also within the [BRA.GetAdjective] Mark and the Prussian territories."
 POM_liberate_pomerelia_title: "Liberate Pomerelia"
 POM_liberate_pomerelia_desc: "When Pomerania is spoken of, it usually means the territories natively held by the Gryf Dynasty. Often forgotten is that there exists Pomerelia - the Eastern Part of Pomerania which has long been separated from the rest. Currently it is the subject of the squabbles between the Teutonic Knights and the Polish Crown, perhaps it's time to enforce our sovereignty upon these territories. While these territories are more slavic, the German urban population and the large maritime cities don't make these lands all that different from Pomerania itself."
 POM_support_the_merchants_title: "Support the Burghers"
 POM_support_the_merchants_desc: "Pomerania without burghers is like a person without a soul - maritime commerce is at the very core of our country. What else shall we do then but support the very heart of our country - the merchants. Fostering an environment of peace and cooperation between us and the guilds can only bring us benefits and prosperity."
 POM_minting_a_coin_title: "Minting a Coin"
 POM_minting_a_coin_desc: "In the year of 1500, Boguslaw the Great has issued the 'Boguslaw' coin to be minted in Stettin. It weighted 4,86g of which 4.29 was pure silver and was worth half of a mark, or 8 schillings. The issue of a new coin cemented the Boguslaw's revitalization of the [POM.GetAdjective] Economy."
 POM_legacy_of_eric_title: "Legacy of Eric"
 POM_legacy_of_eric_desc: "Eric of Pomerania is certainly one of the most prominent rulers of the House of Gryf. His fame is largely attributed to his coronation as the first king of the Kalmar Union - an entity spanning from the green fields of Jutland to the coasts of Finnmark. Unfortunately though, Eric has recently been ousted from the throne, which is now held by a new dynasty. The time is nigh to restore the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to the thrones bounded by Union in Kalmar!"

The Stettiner Royal Family has, as unfortunate as it may sound, died out of a plague outbreak. If we don't act quick, their relatives will be quick to seize the throne for themselves. Shall we move in and occupy our rightful birthright?"
