 lan_culla_rinascimento_desc: "Florence, the flourishing Florence, amidst this flourishing upsurge, we are bound to be at it's shining center. Why of course, who else has written La Divina Commedia, Il Canzonziere, Decameron. While others have been started scrapping at some new fangled ideals, we have already encompassed them for a century."
 lan_dominio_mediceo_title: "Dominio Mediceo"
 lan_dominio_mediceo_desc: "The Gothic style was created for Suger, abbot of St-Denis, advisor to two kings of France: the Renaissance for the merchants of Florence, bankers of the kings of Europe. \nThe cultural and scientific renewal began in the last decades of the fourteenth century and in the early fifteenth century in Florence and had its roots in the rediscovery of the classics, which had already begun in the fourteenth century by Francesco Petrarca and other scholars. In their works, man began to be the central argument rather than God (Petrarch's Canzoniere and Boccaccio's Decameron are a clear example). The "rebirth" succeeded in having an extraordinarily wide diffusion and continuity, from which a new perception of man and the world arose, where the single individual is able to self-determine and cultivate his skills, with which he will be able to win Fortuna (in the Latin sense, "fate") and to dominate nature by changing it."

 lan_santa_maria_fiore_title: "Santa Maria del Fiore"
 lan_santa_maria_fiore_desc: "In the interior of San Petronio not only the square plan of the median vaults, but the general proportions of the building, as well as that singular character of thriftiness, indeed of poverty, recall Santa Maria del Fiore.\nHowever, while in this church the vertical line of the pointed arch was contrasted, for an innate classical feeling, by the gallery, as if to contrast the slender effect of the arch itself, and to destroy the logical signification of the Gothic structure, in San Petronio no a foreign element disturbs the internal grandeur of the space and the arduous impetus of the vaults: hence the effect that the Bolognese church produces in comparison to the Florentine one is more full and lively."
 lan_spedale_innocenti_title: "Spedale degli Innocenti"
 lan_spedale_innocenti_desc: "The hospital was born thanks to a bequest of a thousand florins from the Prato merchant Francesco Datini to the Hospital of Santa Maria Nova to create a place of welcome for abandoned children. The term "hospital" derives from the ancient Florentine dialect, while the name should be understood as "hospital for abandoned children", referring to the biblical episode of the massacre of the innocents. It was the first specialized orphanage in Europe and one of the first Renaissance architecture in the world, perhaps the first ever, and is based on an initial design by Filippo Brunelleschi."
 lan_arti_locali_title: "Arti Locali"

 lan_patron_churches_title: "Patron of Churches"
 lan_patron_churches_desc: "Money that's been locked away in a bank has no use for us or the people. Perhaps, investing it great constructions projects will pave way as a symbol of our might and power, and make us loved by all."
 lan_control_church_title: "Control the Church"
 lan_control_church_desc: "Money that's been locked away in a bank has no use for us or the people. Perhaps, investing it great constructions projects will pave way as a symbol of our might and power, and make us loved by all."

The Tuscan males were enrolled in the age group between 20 and 50 years both with voluntary and forced enrollment, proceeding with a general commissioner to a selection every 3 or 4 years based on contingent needs, excluding Florentine citizens for unreliability and those Pistoia because they were considered too turbulent and undisciplined."
 lan_take_lucca_title: "Take Lucca"
 lan_take_lucca_desc: "The inhabitants of Lucca are proud of their independent history.
