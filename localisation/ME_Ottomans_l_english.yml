 ME_Ottoman_Events.11.d: "The Emirate of Sicily was a taifa established in the island of Sicily after it's conquest by the Caliphs. With the fall of the islands to the Norman insurrections, the Emirate of Sicily was lost in history. With our re-conquest of the island many of the Muslim populace found in the island are coming out of hiding and are embracing us as liberators and saviours.
