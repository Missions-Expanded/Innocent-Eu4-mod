The French translation of the "High Gate" "Sublime Porte" (the adjective being unusually placed ahead of the word to emphasise its importance) was soon adopted in most other European languages, including English, to refer not only to the actual gate but as a metaphor for the Ottoman Empire."

With the fall of the islands to the Norman insurrections, the Emirate of Sicily was lost in history. With our re-conquest of the island many of the Muslim populace found in the island are coming out of hiding and are embracing us as liberators and saviours.

 ME_Ottoman_Events.13.t: "To Avert a Disaster"
 ME_Ottoman_Events.13.d: "With the liberation of Iberia from the infidels many have rejoiced and have started celebrating this marvelous deed, yet some are fearful on what to come. They forsee a new Christian reconquista which will aim to reclaim the lands they lost.
