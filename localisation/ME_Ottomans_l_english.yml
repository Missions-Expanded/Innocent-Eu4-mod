It is said that he dismounted and fell to his knees and prayed mid-battle, something a legendary Caliph had done. The battle immediately turned in their favor. Murad II styled himself like this - a Ghazi King - strongly, as one meant to embody the virtues of an honest warrior. Despite that, he had grown tired of his nearly two decades of constant warfare, for he did not enjoy ruling from the throne or the responsibilities that went with it. He decided to abdicate the throne to his son, Mehmed II following the victory at Varna.

Currently, the Mamluks have succumbed to our invasion, and their lands lie at our mercy.
