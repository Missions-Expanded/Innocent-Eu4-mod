 Melva_Mantua_Events.1.T: "Antonio di Puccio Pisano"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.1.D: "In the first half of the century a late Gothic taste prevailed as in the rest of the Lombardy area, with the fundamental stay of Pisanello as a court artist known above all for the splendid large frescoes, suspended between realism and the fantastic world and populated by countless figures, with bright colors and precise strokes."
 Melva_Mantua_Events.1.OPT1: "Show us your paintings!"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.2.T: "Leon Battista Alberti"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.2.D: "Italian architect, writer, mathematician, humanist, cryptographer, linguist, philosopher, musician and archaeologist; he is one of the most multifaceted artistic figures of the Renaissance. Alberti is part of the second generation of humanists (the one following Vergerio, Bruni, Bracciolini, Francesco Barbaro). A constant interest of him was the search for rules, theoretical or practical, capable of guiding the work of artists. In his works he mentioned some canons, for example: in the "De statue" he exposed the proportions of the human body, in the "De pictura" he provided the first definition of the scientific perspective and finally in the "De re aedificatoria", he described all the cases relating modern architecture, emphasizing the importance of the project and the different types of buildings according to their function."
 Melva_Mantua_Events.2.OPT1: "He will work on our temples!"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.3.T: "Chiesa di San Sebastiano"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.3.D: "The first Mantuan intervention concerned the church of San Sebastiano, a private chapel of the Gonzagas, begun in 1460. The building was the foundation for the Renaissance reflections on the Greek cross buildings: it is in fact divided into two floors, one of which is underground apsidal arms around a cubic body with a cross vault; the front arm is preceded by a portico, today with five openings. The upper part of the façade, divided by giant pilasters, is original of the Albertian project and recalls an elaboration of the classical temple, with a broken architrave, tympanum and a Syriac arch, testifying to the extreme freedom with which the architect arranged the elements. Perhaps the inspiration was a late antique work, such as the Orange Arch. The two connecting stairways that allow access to the portico are not part of the original project, but were added later. "
 Melva_Mantua_Events.3.OPT1: "We will fund the project"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.3.OPT2: "We cannot afford it now"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.4.T: "Basilica di Sant'Andrea"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.4.D: "The ancient lexicon was manipulated with equal ease in the Basilica of Sant'Andrea, despite, also in this case, the tampering with the original projects that occurred during construction, after the death of Alberti. The building was born to replace a shrine where a precious relic of the blood of Christ was venerated. Alberti changed the orientation of the church aligning it with the road axis that connected Palazzo Ducale to the Tea. The church has a Latin cross plan, with a single, large barrel vaulted nave with lacunars, on which side chapels with a rectangular base open up. The choice was also linked to specific ancient references, such as the Etruscan temple described by Vitruvius and the Basilica of Maxentius. In order to monumentally seal the entire area, particular importance was given to the façade, set as a triumphal arch with a single archway between walls, even more monumental than the previous example on the façade of the Malatesta Temple. Greater emphasis is then given by a second upper arch, beyond the tympanum, which marks the height of the nave and which, thanks to the internal opening, allows the lighting of the building. The atrium has a great thickness, as a filtering point between inside and outside, which also recurs in the layout of the internal chapels."
 Melva_Mantua_Events.4.OPT1: "We shall erect the greatest basilica"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.4.OPT2: "The project will be fallimentary"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.5.T: "Scuola di Mantova"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.5.D: "Mantua was conquered by the Renaissance spirit from the middle of the 15th century, depending entirely on the Gonzaga dynasty, which made the city, despite the smallness of the territory and its relative importance on the European chessboard, one of the most beautiful courses in Europe. On a strictly sociological level, and unlike other Renaissance Italian centers of development, Mantua was at that time deeply linked to the reigning family: the sponsorship and commissions of the Gonzaga, however important they were, mainly aimed only at the interests of the prince. . Also, under these conditions, the artists and craftsmen solicited by the Gonzaga are totally dependent on the Mantuan court."
 Melva_Mantua_Events.5.OPT1: "Marvelous!"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.6.T: "Castello di San Giorgio"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.6.D: "Built on the rubble of the church of Santa Maria di Capo di Bove starting from 1395 and completed in 1406 on commission by Francesco I Gonzaga and on a project by Bartolino da Novara, the castle of San Giorgio is a square-plan building consisting of four corner towers and surrounded by a moat with three doors and relative drawbridges, aimed at defending the city. "
 Melva_Mantua_Events.6.OPT1: "Marble, Honour and Virtue"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.7.T: "Reggia dei Gonzaga"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.7.D: "From 1308 it was the official residence of the lords of Mantua, the Bonacolsi, and therefore the main residence of the Gonzagas, lords, marquises and finally dukes of the Virgilian city. It housed the dominant Gonzaga of the time, his wife, the legitimate first-born son and the other legitimate children up to the age of majority as well as important guests. "
 Melva_Mantua_Events.7.OPT1: "It will house our guests!"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.8.T: "Celeste Galeria"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.8.D: "It was in the 15th century that the most important art collections were formed by the Princes of the Renaissance. Among the largest were the collections of the Popes, the Medici and the Gonzagas. Initially they were directed towards the testimonies of the classical world, and then sculptures, bronzes, coins and medals from the Greek and Roman times. But the Princes, who became patrons, began to commission works from contemporary artists. Inspiration of the Gonzagas were the Wunderkammer of the Princes of Bavaria. In particular, Isabella d'Este looked to this model by creating her own personal study that acquired international notoriety. The Gonzaga collections themselves became an example for the European courts, also for the proverbial intuition shown by the Gonzagas in the choice of the works of their contemporaries. Likewise, art collecting became an instrument of representation and communication in the subtle diplomatic game to which the small Mantuan state necessarily had to apply. The maximum splendor came during the government of the Dukes Vincenzo I Gonzaga and Ferdinando (son of Vincenzo I). By the will of the latter the works of art were inventoried, for the time an inventory prepared with avant-garde criteria, the usefulness of which turned out to be even greater because the diaspora of the works kept in the palaces of Mantua was about to begin. "
 Melva_Mantua_Events.8.OPT1: "Look at this beauty!"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.9.T: "Condotte Militari"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.9.D: "The fortunes of the family were also linked to military conduct, inaugurated with Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, first marquis of Mantua, in 1410. Militating as a captain first under the flags of Venice and then of Milan, he expanded the borders of the Gonzaga state with the territories he received in exchange for their military services. The survival of the small state was strongly tied to its ability to offer military strength and expertise to major powers in exchange for protection."
 Melva_Mantua_Events.9.OPT1: "The time of diplomacy is over!"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.10.T: "Jew Community of Mantua"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.10.D: "The presence of Jews in Mantua is testified by the first certain documents, as far back as 1145. The Gonzagas encouraged Jewish immigration, also aimed at obtaining immediate economic interests from the Jewish bankers exercising through the feneratizi banks, the loan of money at interest. There were three main immigration flows, from Rome, Germany and Provence. At the end of the sixteenth century, one of the largest Italian Jewish communities of the time was created in Mantua: over 3,000 people, or 7% of the city's population. At the same time Jewish families carrying out the credit activity moved to the smaller centers governed by the Gonzagas; therefore, small communities with fenerative benches, synagogues and Jewish cemeteries arose in Ostiano (Cremona), Rivarolo Mantovano, Viadana, Pomponesco, Bozzolo, Castel Goffredo."
 Melva_Mantua_Events.10.OPT1: "We will pardon but control them"

 Melva_Mantua_Events.11.T: "Mantuan Ghetto"
 Melva_Mantua_Events.11.D: "In Mantua, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, a large Jewish community (over 3,000 people) had been created following a policy of religious tolerance pursued by the Gonzagas. In fact, the establishment of the ghetto was endured, not without resistance, by the Gonzagas in compliance with the provisions of Pope Paul IV contained in the Bull Cum nimis absurdum of 1555. 7% of the city population, 408 families, was forced to concentrate in the then districts of the Camel and the Griffin enclosed by doors that opened at dawn and closed at sunset. The ghettoisation coincided with the beginning of the decline of the Mantuan Jewish community parallel to that of the dominant Gonzaga family. "
 Melva_Mantua_Events.11.OPT1: "They will stay"
