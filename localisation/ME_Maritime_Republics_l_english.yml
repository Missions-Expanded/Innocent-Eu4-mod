 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.2.T: "A Steady Timber Supply"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.2.D: "Acquisition of our own domestic supply of quality timber will allow us to build vessels without having to rely on foreign sources. As such, the capacity of the Arsenal to supply our navy can be expanded greatly.\n\nIn addition to the obvious applications, our new supply of wood can also be used as wooden piles, meant for expanding [Root.Capital.GetName] and erecting new structures."
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.2.OPT1: "Excellent"

 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.3.T: "The Porta Magna"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.3.D: "The Arsenal has been a key Venetian institution since its construction in 1104; since then, it has seen the Republic through many battles by providing the state with tens of thousands of warships through the centuries. To commemorate its very existence, we have decided to build a great gate at the entrance. This grand monument is inspired old Roman structures and marks a new era for the art and architecture in Venice and all of Italy."
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.3.OPT1: "It is wondrous."

 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.4.T: "Flotta Permanente"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.4.D: "In our civilization of wood, shipbuilding was not standardized, the shipwrights were craftsmen, and as craftsmen they made ships as single and unique products, although undoubtedly with a traceable structure. The vessels during their life often underwent even radical transformations. For example, the armed merchant ships, before taking up service, passed through the Arsenal where they were modified, assuming characteristics more suitable for war use and, often, even radically changing their appearance. \nThe organs of our government in charge of organizing the naval forces chose the merchant ships to be armed in war on the basis of both operational and economic needs. A first distinction concerned the seasonality of operations. For operations in the good season, rowed woods were preferred, more suitable for sailing in the calm summer. Conversely, in winter the choice usually fell on sailing ships, because they held the sea better in bad weather. A second distinction concerned operational purposes. For the hunting operations of the small rebel ships, light woods with oars were more suitable (i.e. gondolas, leudi, escapades, feluccas and felucones), due to greater maneuverability and agility, especially offshore. However, the naval forces were not only intended for hunting rebel corsairs and smugglers, but also had to carry out transport missions, to support land military operations and to counter the anti-Barbary race. In this case, the larger sailing ships and rowing vessels (such as rowing brigantine and galleys) were more suitable, because they had greater load capacity than light woods and, being better armed, were more suitable for dealing with Barbary boats."
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.4.OPT1: "We must secure our mercantile fleet."
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.4.OPT2: "Our galleys are supreme!"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.4.OPT3: "New Oceans awaits us"

 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.7.T: "The Goods of Cyprus"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.7.D: "The formal annexation of the island of Cyprus has been a long time coming, with the various intertwining deals involving the Lusignan dynasty and the Republic. The territory has always been an excellent source of salt and grains to feed the homeland, but an debate has begun amongst the upper echelon of the [Root.Culture.GetName] bureaucracy on whether our efforts are better spent cultivating the fields or harvesting the salt pans. The Senate wishes to further our grip on the salt monopoly, while the Council of Ten wishes the focus on wheat exports to properly prepare for future shortages and famines."
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.7.OPT1: "We need to keep that monopoly going!"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.7.OPT2: "Follow the Council. What good is money if you can't eat?"

 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.8.T: "Wealth of the Orient"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.8.D: "Our re-entry as a major player in the spice trade has brought with it all the wealth and riches one might expect. Tales of [Root.Capital.GetName] are told from near and far, describing the opulent structures, extravagant citizens, and bountiful lifestyles. This would harken back to the height of our Republic, but that time is now."
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.8.OPT1: "A sight to behold!"
 ME_Maritime_Republics_Events.8.OPT2: "A sight to behold!"

 maritime_republics_domestic_timber_sources_title: "Domestic Timber Sources"
 maritime_republics_domestic_timber_sources_desc: "Our reliance on foreign timber is a weakness to our very existence. Me must create or seize our own source of timber."
 maritime_republics_galley_magistrate_title: "Magistrato delle Galee"
 maritime_republics_galley_magistrate_desc: "The need for a permanent and public fleet is now more looming than before, the domination of the Italian seas has not shown how the problem relating to it must be addressed and immediately. \nIt was therefore a modest force, however not very suitable for the Corsican war theater, as galleys were not the most suitable vessels for hunting the small ships used by smugglers and rebel corsairs. Especially for this reason the galleys were usually sent underway with at least one felucca, one felucone or a small canned convict. These light units, in fact, were considered crucial for the success of hunting operations, so much so that the captains of the galleys, on the few occasions when they had to operate without their support, did not fail to highlight how necessary they were. These were hired and armed merchant vessels temporarily in the public service."
