 # Missions:
 Avaria_Mountain_men_title: "Mountain Men"
 Avaria_Mountain_men_desc: "We lay along the grand horizontal barrier that is the Caucasus. They provide solace in defense as well as their rich deposits of metal and coal. we needn't regret our surroundings, for we have truly become men of the mountain. This terrain, rugged and rigid, shall provide us once more with safety in the face of the coming storm."
 Avaria_Integrated_Fortifications_title: "Integrated Fortifications"
 Avaria_Integrated_Fortifications_desc: "The rugged terrain of our homeland may leave much to be desired, but each detriment might yet become useful. Of the various settlements surrounding our capital, very few are actually fortified, yet each possesses unique potential for the like. We shan't let these tow go to waste any more. If we fortify each individual, any possible invaders would be forced to split their armies between each settlement in order to assert control over the province, thus greatly increasing both siege time and difficulty."
 Avaria_Guardians_of_our_Own_title: "Guardians of our Own"
 Avaria_Guardians_of_our_Own_desc: "Long enough have we paid tribute to our Gazikumukhan overlords. They may have numbers, but we are their superior in regard to a disciplined and well-trained army. We shan't answer to their whims any more."
 Avaria_Avarian_State_title: "Avarian State"
 Avaria_Avarian_State_desc: "We are a state, but not one of our own volition. We cannot be a truly independent state until we bring about our revolution against our longtime oppressors. Though they have offered defense, oppression comes in many forms..."
 Avaria_Glory_to_Avaria_title: "Glory to Avaria"
 Avaria_Glory_to_Avaria_desc: "We have thrown off our brutal dictators, but now comes the time of deliberation. Deliberation regarding the newfound opportunity we find ourselves in. We could secure the Gazikumkhan territory for ourselves, which would provide further opportunities for both trade and expansion."
 Avaria_Dagestani_Ambition_title: "Dagestani Ambition"
 Avaria_Dagestani_Ambition_desc: "Alongside our great conquests comes the responsibility of providing protection to oppressed and ignored peoples, such as those residing in the rest of Dagestan. Perhaps the time has come to consolidate the area and ensure all of our people remain under our warm embrace."
 Avaria_Turmoil_in_Disguise_title: "Turmoil in Disguise"
 Avaria_Turmoil_in_Disguise_desc: "Tensions are high. We are not at risk of rebellion nor revolt, but our people are engaged in a silent war. The streets are run rampant with deathly glares, and our two primary factions, our Sunni citizens and our Orthodox minorities, want nothing more than to be ridded of the other. While mass expulsion is out of the question, we must give the people the solace they desperately need by ensuring the state's stability." 
 Avaria_Beneath_the_mountains_title: "Beneath the Mountain"
 Avaria_Beneath_the_mountains_desc: "Lying beneath these imposing mountains lies a bountiful wealth in the form of gold. We shan't let this valuable resource go to waste. We should establish mining colonies at the foot of the mountain to ensure this wealth is well-utilized."
 Avaria_Ancient_Prosperity_title: "Ancient Prosperity"
 Avaria_Ancient_Prosperity_desc: "As we rise to power, our old ally, the Golden Horde, falls to the bane of mankind: old age. Both the Russians and the Franks push tirelessly at the remnants of this once grand Khaganate, leaving destruction in their considerable wake. We cannot bear to see the ally we once relied on fall to such disparity and ruin. We should see to forging a mutual defense pact with our old friends unless it is too late. Should the latter be true, the least we could do would be to pay tribute to our old friend one last time by bringing its territories under our protection."

 # Decisions:
 Avaria_Return_to_Roots_title: "Return to Roots"
 Avaria_Return_to_Roots_desc: "Alongside our ascension as a regional power in the Caucasus Mountains, we must also consider the debacle of our religion. Currently, both Sunni Islam and Orthodox Christianity vie for dominance within our borders, both influencing both our politics and people. Perhaps a middle ground would be best suited. In accordance with ancient Mongol tradition, we could return to a Shamanistic style of worship, favoring neither parties."
