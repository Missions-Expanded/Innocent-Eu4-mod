 mng_lessons_talas_title: "Lessons of Talas"
 mng_lessons_talas_desc: "Several centuries have passed since the armies of the Tang dynasty was defeated at Talasby the Arabs.

 mng_secure_liaoning_title: "Secure Liaoning"
 mng_secure_liaoning_desc: "The Liaoning area is vulnerable to enemy invasion. We should increase our territorial depth in this area to prevent an attack by land from cutting off the area from the heartland. Such an expansion will have to come at the expense of the Jurchens, of course, but this would be a good opportunity to limit their growth and reduce their potential threat as well."
 mng_sino_korean_border_title: "Sino-Korean Border"
 mng_sino_korean_border_desc: "The mountainous region that separates the Korean peninsula from Manchuria is vital for us to hold if we require a line of defence against an army invading from Korea. We would also be able to reduce Jurchen power and prevent their unification in the region, thereby eliminating a potential threat."
 mng_nurgan_commission_title: "The Nurgan Commission"
 mng_nurgan_commission_desc: "Many years ago the Yongle Emperor established the Nurgan Regional Military Commission in Manchuria after securing control of the region. We should reestablish the Commission and bring enlightenment to the barbarians."

 mng_construct_new_marketplaces_title: "Construct New Marketplaces"

 mng_avert_tumu_desc: "The court astrologer has informed us of "terrible omens" that will bring disastrous consequences for our empire at Tumu. The barbarians probably have something to do with this, so we should strengthen our hold on the region."

 mng_push_back_four_oirats_desc: "The barbarians are still raiding our borders. Every time they run low on supplies, they come and raid us hoping that we will eventually agree to trade some goods in exchange for peace. No more!

 mng_end_north_yuan_title: "The End of North Yuan"
 mng_end_north_yuan_desc: "Though the North Yuan dynasty was decisively defeated decades ago, the remanants of that fallen empire still exist in Mongolia and remain a potential threat if coupled with the other northern barbarians. We should eliminate them once and for all while they are divided."
 mng_western_protectorate_title: "The Western Protectorate"
 mng_western_protectorate_desc: "The Tang dynasty extended the reach of Chinese power far into the west and set up the Western Protectorate. Instead of just securing the important borderland of Hami, we should emulate their success at securing the Silk Road and holding this diverse region."
 mng_sino_korean_relations_title: "Sino-Korean Relations"
 mng_sino_korean_relations_desc: "The Korean peninsula is of massive importance to our national security. Not only is Korea a brother Confucian nation, foreign armies attacking into China have the potential to strike deep into the heartland if they are victorious, and retreat beyond the Yalu River and Changbai Mountains if they are defeated. Whether we choose to pull Korea closer to us or to engage in aggressive diplomacy and bring the peninsula under our direct rule, Korea cannot be ignored."
 mng_four_han_commanderies_title: "The Four Han Commanderies"
 mng_four_han_commanderies_desc: "During the Han dynasty, the part of the Korean peninsula north of the Han River was split into four commanderies under Han rule, with the Lelang commandery being the most famous and longest-lasting.

 mng_shake_changwei_desc: "The Embroided Uniform Guard and the Eastern Depot are the secret police and spy agencies of the Ming dynasty founded by the Hongwu and Yongle emperors. There have been reports that they have implicated numerous officials and civilians in unfair trials. While useful for "influencing" domestic politics, we should ensure that their excess energies are directed against the right people."
 mng_meritocratic_court_title: "Meritocratic Court"
 mng_meritocratic_court_desc: "The abolishment of the position of Grand Chancellor meant that we had to rely on the Grand Secretariat and the Cabinet. If we are to maintain a certain standard of administration we will need more competent ministers."
 mng_tuntian_system_title: "The Tuntian System"
 mng_tuntian_system_desc: "Chinese dynasties relied on the Tuntian system to ensure that soldiers would spend some of their time working in the farms and the rest of their time guarding the frontier.

 mng_governance_virtue_title: "Governance by Virtue"

 mng_west_sea_desc: "The Rebgong region contains what is known as the West Sea, the Qinghai Lake, which is one of the largest saltwater lakes in the world and also the Tibetan holy mountain of Amne Machin. Control of the region would allow us greater influence in Tibetan affairs."
 mng_amdo_kham_commision_title: "Amdo-Kham Commission"
 mng_amdo_kham_commision_desc: "The military commissions that we set up in Tibet have been mostly autonomous in nature, with the Tibetans mostly providing support to the Ming emperors in the form of Buddhism. It is time we made them a more integral part of the empire. Taking actual control of the Dokham Regional Military Commission should be our first step."
 mng_secure_tibet_title: "Secure Tibet"
 mng_secure_tibet_desc: "With Dokham secured, it is time we reestablished the Ü-Tsang and Elis Regional Military Commissions in order to secure the Tibetan plateau and unite the various minor Tibetan polities. Only then will order be brought to the region."
 mng_patron_buddhism_title: "Patron of Buddhism"
 mng_patron_buddhism_desc: "Buddhism has been nearly wiped out from its homeland, as the Son of Heaven and the protector of Buddhism, we should declare ourselves the Patron of the Buddha and bring the holy sites under our control."

 mng_topple_imperial_throne_title: "The Imperial Throne"
 mng_topple_imperial_throne_desc: "The Emperor of Japan is, at least nominally the leader of the Japanese people. Capturing the Imperial Palace at Kyoto may not result in an instant capitulation of all of Japan, but it will certainly be a blow to their morale, and might allow us to claim the Chrysanthymum Throne ourselves."
 mng_fall_samurai_title: "Fall of the Samurai"
 mng_fall_samurai_desc: "The samurai caste has occupied the top position in Japanese society for far too long, it is time we ended this and establish the intelligentsia as the ruling class instead."
 mng_lost_expedition_title: "The Lost Expedition"
 mng_lost_expedition_desc: "Some barbarian sailor from beyond the Western Ocean claims that a Chinese fleet reached a vast land in the east in 1421, beyond the islands of Japan, and that some of our people settled there. Strangely, no one seems to remember this expedition to the east. Maybe we can try going that way and see if we can find our allegedly lost people."
 mng_to_the_south_title: "To the South"
 mng_to_the_south_desc: "During our search for the lost expedition, we have heard rumours that some of our men may have made their way down south beyond the islands of Jawa and Timor. While our traders have already been there and came back empty handed apart from reports of weird animals, we should still establish a permanent settlement there as a base for further exploration."
 mng_five_peoples_china_title: "Five Peoples of China"
 mng_five_peoples_china_desc: "From time immemorial, China has always been a multiethnic empire and tribe after tribe has joined civilization. The assimilation and integration of foreign peoples over time is nothing new and should be encouraged."

 mng_reform_hanlinyuan_desc: "Contact with the foreign barbarians from the west have shown that we are falling behind. We must implement education reforms and give more opportunities for the non-literati if we are to remain the centre of the world."

# Missions, 4th column
 mng_burmese_expeditions_title: "Burmese Expeditions"

 mng_outlet_west_ocean_title: "Outlet to the West Ocean"
 mng_outlet_west_ocean_desc: "With our control over Burma more or less secured, we now have direct access to the ports on the Burmese coast and should use them to imrpove our trading prospects."
 mng_indian_commerce_title: "Indian Commerce"
 mng_indian_commerce_desc: "The riches of India are seemingly infinite, and we would be wise to adopt a more mercantile position when it comes to trade in the region. It would certainly help if Bengal was one of our tributaries again..."
 mng_contact_with_ainu_title: "Contact with the Ainu"
 mng_contact_with_ainu_desc: "There is apparently an indigenous tribe called the Ainu living to the north of the Japanese islands. Establishing contact with them may prove useful when dealing with the Japanese later on."

 mng_quest_fusang_title: "Quest for Fusang"
 mng_quest_fusang_desc: "According to the Liang Shu, there exists a nation around 20,000 li to the east of China, where the sun rises over a mulberry tree. The ways of the people here seem to match the description recorded...Could it be? Is this the land of Fusang?"

# Missions, 5th column
 mng_sino_viet_relations_title: "Sino-Viet Relations"
 mng_sino_viet_relations_desc: "The lands of Dai Viet had been under Chinese administration for 1000 years. Though they have broken free and adopted many Chinese ways they remain heavily influenced by Chinese culture and society, which is not surprising given that most of the ruling class has Chinese ancestry and continue to learn the Chinese language and customs. We must decide on our future relationship."
 mng_retake_jiao_zhi_title: "Retake Jiao Zhi"
 mng_retake_jiao_zhi_desc: "It was not too long ago that we withdrew from the south. We should reestablish our administration in Jiao Zhi when the time is right. The local elites will resist, but they will eventually accept incorporation over time. And this time, we will not leave again."

 mng_chinese_sea_title: "A Chinese Sea"
 mng_chinese_sea_desc: "The South Sea has always been our backyard. States like Brunei and Suluseem to have forgotten this and stopped paying us tribute.

 mng_befriends_islanders_title: "Befriend the Islanders"

 mng_nanyang_chinese_desc: "The "Bamboo Network" of Chinese traders has always been present in the lands around the Southern Ocean, and many of the local elites have either Chinese ancestry or ties with Chinese traders.

 mng_subjugate_kotte_title: "Subjugate Kotte"

 mng_new_route_europe_title: "New Route to Europe"
 mng_new_route_europe_desc: "It seems we have reached "Europe". Their ways are strange and the people reek of beef and look as pale as ghosts. Silk, tea and porcelain from our nation is very much in demand here, though they have nothing to offer us in return other than some silver and gold.  Nevertheless, we believe that we have much to learn from their "science", however unbelievable it may seem..."

# Events
 ME_Ming_Events.14.t: "The Ningbo Incident"
 ME_Ming_Events.14.d: "The Ningbo Incident occurred when Japanese trading fleets from two different daimyo families arrived at Ningbo. The fleet carrying outdated tallies arrived later than the first but managed to be received first and received preferential treatment due to the use of bribes. This resulted in a dispute leading to the death of the commander of the second fleet and an investigation into the corruption by Chinese officials. The subsequent clampdown on trade led to increased piracy and smuggling."
 ME_Ming_Events.14.a: "Curses! Crush these pirates!"
 ME_Ming_Events.14.b: "Reopen trade with increased controls and better regulations."

 ME_Ming_Events.15.t: "Sea Cucumbers!"
 ME_Ming_Events.15.d: "It has come to our attention that in the recently captured area of Furdan, there is a small fishing village with a name along the lines of "Sea Cucumber Cliffs" in a bay called "Sea Cucumber Bay". The place is known for its sea cucumbers, and our naval officers would have suggested developing it as a port were it not for the fact that the water freezes over for nearly half the year."
 ME_Ming_Events.15.a: "Designate the village as a new centre of the sea cucumber industry."
 ME_Ming_Events.15.b: "Our ships could use a small supply port out there."

 ME_Ming_Events.16.t: "Mount Penglai"
 ME_Ming_Events.16.d: "When Qin Shi Huang sent Xu Fu to hunt for the elixir of life, he was supposed to search for Mount Penglai, where magical fruits that would grant eternal life when eaten grew. He was unsuccessful and ended up reaching Japan, where he named Mount Fuji as Mount Penglai instead. Apparently, he settled there and gave rise to the Japanese people. Mount Hanasan on Jizhou Island is unlikely to be the real Penglai, but claiming it as such could give us some much-needed development on the island."
 ME_Ming_Events.16.a: "Excellent. Let's see how much money we can make from gullible fools."
 ME_Ming_Events.16.b: "No one will fall for that. Use it for horse grazing like the Mongols did."
 ME_Ming_Events.16.c: "Make it a penal colony."

 ME_Ming_Events.21.t: "Journey to the West"
 ME_Ming_Events.21.d: ""Your Majesty, what ability and what virtue does your poor monk possess that he should merit such affection from your Heavenly Grace? I shall not spare myself this journey, but I shall proceed with all diligence until I reach the Western Heaven. If I do not attain my goal, or the true scriptures, I shall not return to our land even if I have to die. I would rather fall into eternal perdition in Hell."  --Xuanzang, Chapter 12\n\nBased on historical events and written by Wu Chengen, the Great Classical Novel, Journey to the West, described how the Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, went to India to visit Buddhist sites and obtain Buddhist scriptures. His return to China facilitated the flourishing of Buddhism and its subsequent spread in China and the rest of East Asia. In the novel, he is accompanied on his journey by three disciples, including a powerful monkey, a reliable but lazy pig person, and a river ogre. The events described are mostly mythical and is overall comedic in nature."
 ME_Ming_Events.21.a: "Marvelous."
 ME_Ming_Events.21.b: "I like the part about the pig."

 ME_Ming_Events.24.t: "Outlaws of the Marsh"
 ME_Ming_Events.24.d: ""Within the bounds of the four seas, all men are brothers."  --Chapter 44\n\nPossibly written by Shi Naian and revised by Luo Guanzhong, the second of the Four Great Classical Novels, Outlaws of the Marsh describes how 108 outlaws gather at Liangshan Marsh and form a sizable army before being granted amnesty and called in to resist invaders and suppress rebels. Although a work of fiction, scenes involving the characters performing extraordinary feats like killing tigers and uprooting a tree with his bare hands alone are very memorable, and the novel would also be the base for the erotic novel Jin Ping Mei."
 ME_Ming_Events.24.a: "Inspiring."
 ME_Ming_Events.24.b: "I just feel like punching a corrupt official."
