 mng_sino_korean_border_title: "Sino-Korean Border"
 mng_sino_korean_border_desc: "The mountainous region that separates the Korean peninsula from Manchuria is vital for us to hold if we require a line of defence against an army invading from Korea.

 mng_sino_korean_relations_desc: "The Korean peninsula is of massive importance to our national security. Not only is Korea a brother Confucian nation, foreign armies attacking into China have the potential to strike deep into the heartland if they are victorious, and retreat beyond the Yalu River and Changbai Mountains if they are defeated.

 mng_meritocratic_court_title: "Meritocratic Court"

Nevertheless, we believe that we have much to learn from their "science", however unbelievable it may seem..."
