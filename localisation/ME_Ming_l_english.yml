 mng_confront_bear_desc: "It seems that there is a growing threat to our borders. These "Russians" and their "Cossacks", as they call themselves are increasingly encroaching on the vast expanse that is our Siberian territory. We shall deal with these barbarians the same way we have dealt with all other barbarians."
 mng_lessons_talas_title: "Lessons of Talas"
 mng_lessons_talas_desc: "Several centuries have passed since the armies of the Tang dynasty was defeated at Talasby the Arabs. Tang expansion westwards was permanently checked and the secrets of paper-making were taken all the way to Europe. We will learn from their mistakes and consolidate our hold over the western regions for good this time."
 mng_secure_liaoning_title: "Secure Liaoning"
 mng_secure_liaoning_desc: "The Liaoning area is vulnerable to enemy invasion. We should increase our territorial depth in this area to prevent an attack by land from cutting off the area from the heartland. Such an expansion will have to come at the expense of the Jurchens, of course, but this would be a good opportunity to limit their growth and reduce their potential threat as well."
 mng_sino_korean_border_title: "Sino-Korean Border"
 mng_sino_korean_border_desc: "The mountainous region that separates the Korean peninsula from Manchuria is vital for us to hold if we require a line of defence against an army invading from Korea. We would also be able to reduce Jurchen power and prevent their unification in the region, thereby eliminating a potential threat."
 mng_nurgan_commission_title: "The Nurgan Commission"
 mng_nurgan_commission_desc: "Many years ago the Yongle Emperor established the Nurgan Regional Military Commission in Manchuria after securing control of the region. We should reestablish the Commission and bring enlightenment to the barbarians."

 mng_construct_new_marketplaces_title: "Construct New Marketplaces"
 mng_construct_new_marketplaces_desc: "As part of our economic reforms, we will develop cash crops and new markets in rural areas. This will be a new development for the economy, but it will also be a profitable one."

 mng_chinese_traders_desc: "For millennia, our traders have travelled in search of business opportunities overseas and some of them have even settled in foreign lands. Let us make use of these oversea traders to increase our trade capabilities."
 mng_china_china_title: "China of China"
 mng_china_china_desc: "The kilns at Jingdezhen are important producers of Chinese porcelain and exports to Europe eventually led to its imitation by the Dutch in the form of Delftware. We should actively encourage the development of the kilns and support their artistic efforts."

 mng_avert_tumu_title: "Avert Tumu"
 mng_avert_tumu_desc: "The court astrologer has informed us of "terrible omens" that will bring disastrous consequences for our empire at Tumu. The barbarians probably have something to do with this, so we should strengthen our hold on the region."
 mng_push_back_four_oirats_title: "Push Back the Four Oirats"
 mng_push_back_four_oirats_desc: "The barbarians are still raiding our borders. Every time they run low on supplies, they come and raid us hoping that we will eventually agree to trade some goods in exchange for peace. No more! We must learn from the Han dynasty, push back the Four Oirats back from whence they came, put an end to their raids and bring peace to the frontier."
 mng_end_north_yuan_title: "The End of North Yuan"
 mng_end_north_yuan_desc: "Though the North Yuan dynasty was decisively defeated decades ago, the remnants of that fallen empire still exist in Mongolia and remain a potential threat if coupled with the other northern barbarians. We should eliminate them once and for all while they are divided."
 mng_western_protectorate_title: "The Western Protectorate"
 mng_western_protectorate_desc: "The Tang dynasty extended the reach of Chinese power far into the west and set up the Western Protectorate. Instead of just securing the important borderland of Hami, we should emulate their success at securing the Silk Road and holding this diverse region."
 mng_sino_korean_relations_title: "Sino-Korean Relations"
 mng_sino_korean_relations_desc: "The Korean peninsula is of massive importance to our national security. Not only is Korea a brother Confucian nation, foreign armies attacking into China have the potential to strike deep into the heartland if they are victorious, and retreat beyond the Yalu River and Changbai Mountains if they are defeated. Whether we choose to pull Korea closer to us or to engage in aggressive diplomacy and bring the peninsula under our direct rule, Korea cannot be ignored."
 mng_four_han_commanderies_title: "The Four Han Commanderies"
 mng_four_han_commanderies_desc: "During the Han dynasty, the part of the Korean peninsula north of the Han River was split into four commanderies under Han rule, with the Lelang commandery being the most famous and longest-lasting. Now that the northern part of the peninsula is secured we should revive the commanderies."
 mng_ungjin_commandery_title: "Ungjin Commandery"
 mng_ungjin_commandery_desc: "During the Tang dynasty, a joint invasion of Baekje by Tang and Silla forces allowed the Tang to establish the Ungjin Commandery in former Baekje lands. With that part of the peninsula under our control we can consider its revival."

 mng_shake_changwei_desc: "The Embroided Uniform Guard and the Eastern Depot are the secret police and spy agencies of the Ming dynasty founded by the Hongwu and Yongle emperors. There have been reports that they have implicated numerous officials and civilians in unfair trials. While useful for "influencing" domestic politics, we should ensure that their excess energies are directed against the right people."
 mng_meritocratic_court_title: "Meritocratic Court"
 mng_meritocratic_court_desc: "The abolishment of the position of Grand Chancellor meant that we had to rely on the Grand Secretariat and the Cabinet. If we are to maintain a certain standard of administration we will need more competent ministers."
 mng_tuntian_system_title: "The Tuntian System"
 mng_tuntian_system_desc: "Chinese dynasties relied on the Tuntian system to ensure that soldiers would spend some of their time working in the farms and the rest of their time guarding the frontier.

 mng_governance_virtue_title: "Governance by Virtue"

 mng_amdo_kham_commision_desc: "The military commissions that we set up in Tibet have been mostly autonomous in nature, with the Tibetans mostly providing support to the Ming emperors in the form of Buddhism. It is time we made them a more integral part of the empire. Taking actual control of the Dokham Regional Military Commission should be our first step."
 mng_secure_tibet_title: "Secure Tibet"
 mng_secure_tibet_desc: "With Dokham secured, it is time we reestablished the Ü-Tsang and Elis Regional Military Commissions in order to secure the Tibetan plateau and unite the various minor Tibetan polities. Only then will order be brought to the region."
 mng_patron_buddhism_title: "Patron of Buddhism"

 mng_wokou_title: "Wokou"
 mng_wokou_desc: "Ever since the Ningbo Incident, Wokou activities have only increased. They now comprise of not just Japanese but also Chinese and Korean pirates.

 mng_topple_imperial_throne_title: "The Imperial Throne"
 mng_topple_imperial_throne_desc: "The Emperor of Japan is, at least nominally the leader of the Japanese people. Capturing the Imperial Palace at Kyoto may not result in an instant capitulation of all of Japan, but it will certainly be a blow to their morale, and might allow us to claim the Chrysanthemum Throne ourselves."
 mng_fall_samurai_title: "Fall of the Samurai"
 mng_fall_samurai_desc: "The samurai caste has occupied the top position in Japanese society for far too long, it is time we ended this and establish the intelligentsia as the ruling class instead."

 mng_lost_expedition_desc: "Some barbarian sailor from beyond the Western Ocean claims that a Chinese fleet reached a vast land in the east in 1421, beyond the islands of Japan, and that some of our people settled there. Strangely, no one seems to remember this expedition to the east. Maybe we can try going that way and see if we can find our allegedly lost people."
 mng_to_the_south_title: "To the South"
 mng_to_the_south_desc: "During our search for the lost expedition, we have heard rumours that some of our men may have made their way down south beyond the islands of Jawa and Timor.

 mng_five_peoples_china_title: "Five Peoples of China"
 mng_five_peoples_china_desc: "From time immemorial, China has always been a multiethnic empire and tribe after tribe has joined civilization. The assimilation and integration of foreign peoples over time is nothing new and should be encouraged."

 mng_reform_hanlinyuan_desc: "Contact with the foreign barbarians from the west have shown that we are falling behind. We must implement education reforms and give more opportunities for the non-literati if we are to remain the centre of the world."

# Missions, 4th column
 mng_burmese_expeditions_title: "Burmese Expeditions"

 mng_san_xuan_liu_wei_desc: "The Dimasa Pacification Commission and the San Xuan Liu Wei are a group of Pacification Commissions and Superintendencies over which our empire has varying degrees of control. Bringing a successful conclusion to the Ming-Burma war allows us to exert much greater control over them."
 mng_outlet_west_ocean_title: "Outlet to the West Ocean"
 mng_outlet_west_ocean_desc: "With our control over Burma more or less secured, we now have direct access to the ports on the Burmese coast and should use them to improve our trading prospects."
 mng_indian_commerce_title: "Indian Commerce"
 mng_indian_commerce_desc: "The riches of India are seemingly infinite, and we would be wise to adopt a more mercantile position when it comes to trade in the region. It would certainly help if Bengal was one of our tributaries again..."
 mng_contact_with_ainu_title: "Contact with the Ainu"
 mng_contact_with_ainu_desc: "There is apparently an indigenous tribe called the Ainu living to the north of the Japanese islands. Establishing contact with them may prove useful when dealing with the Japanese later on."

 mng_eradicate_southern_piracy_desc: "Pirates are once again roaming the waters in the Straits of Malacca, we must crush them and reestablish the rule of law in the Southern Sea. This will secure the navigation routes for us and our traders."

 mng_quest_fusang_title: "Quest for Fusang"
 mng_quest_fusang_desc: "According to the Liang Shu, there exists a nation around 20,000 li to the east of China, where the sun rises over a mulberry tree. The ways of the people here seem to match the description recorded...Could it be? Is this the land of Fusang?"

 mng_sino_viet_relations_title: "Sino-Viet Relations"
 mng_sino_viet_relations_desc: "The lands of Dai Viet had been under Chinese administration for 1000 years. Though they have broken free and adopted many Chinese ways they remain heavily influenced by Chinese culture and society, which is not surprising given that most of the ruling class has Chinese ancestry and continue to learn the Chinese language and customs. We must decide on our future relationship."
 mng_retake_jiao_zhi_title: "Retake Jiao Zhi"
 mng_retake_jiao_zhi_desc: "It was not too long ago that we withdrew from the south. We should reestablish our administration in Jiao Zhi when the time is right. The local elites will resist, but they will eventually accept incorporation over time. And this time, we will not leave again."

 mng_chinese_sea_title: "A Chinese Sea"
 mng_chinese_sea_desc: "The South Sea has always been our backyard. States like Brunei and Suluseem to have forgotten this and stopped paying us tribute.

 mng_befriends_islanders_title: "Befriend the Islanders"
 mng_befriends_islanders_desc: "The East Sea is much bigger than we thought, and the tribes many. Perhaps by listening to their stories we can learn more about where they came from and how they got there."

We reduced piracy and ensured smooth international trade, dispensing justice when necessary. The first step to reclaiming our glory would be to rebuild the treasure fleets."

 mng_nanyang_chinese_desc: "The "Bamboo Network" of Chinese traders has always been present in the lands around the Southern Ocean, and many of the local elites have either Chinese ancestry or ties with Chinese traders. If we wish to maintain our authority in the region, it would be a good idea to make use of these settled Chinese."
 mng_subjugate_kotte_title: "Subjugate Kotte"
 mng_subjugate_kotte_desc: "After previously helping the ruler of Kotte secure the throne from the ruler of Gampola, it seems that they have forgotten our assistance and stopped paying homage to us. Let us remind them once again of our power."

 mng_new_route_europe_title: "New Route to Europe"
 mng_new_route_europe_desc: "It seems we have reached "Europe". Their ways are strange and the people reek of beef and look as pale as ghosts. Silk, tea and porcelain from our nation is very much in demand here, though they have nothing to offer us in return other than some silver and gold. Nevertheless, we believe that we have much to learn from their "science", however unbelievable it may seem..."

# Events
 ME_Ming_Events.1.t: "Donglin Movement"
 ME_Ming_Events.1.d: "The Donglin movement was established in 1604 when officials concerned with the state of the bureaucracy and wished for a return to moral Confucian traditions restored the Donglin Academy, which later became a centre of dissent. The movement found many supporters and was deeply involved in factional politics, notably being involved in forcing the Wanli Emperor to designate his first-born son as heir. The factional bickering would eventually culminate in the opposition with the eunuch faction and its leader Wei Zhongxian and the following closure of the Academy and the execution of its head. However, the movement would continue to be revived and influence imperial politics time and time again."
 ME_Ming_Events.1.a: "Curses!"

 ME_Ming_Events.2.t: "Wang Yangming"
 ME_Ming_Events.2.d: "Wang Shouren, better known as Wang Yangming, was the governor responsible for defeating the Prince of Ning's rebellion. More importantly, he was ranked as one of the great masters of Confucianism apart from Confucius, Mencius and Zhu Xi. Denying the rationalist dualism of Zhu Xi, his Yangming School of Mind went on to influence many prominent thinkers, including one of the Four Great Men of Kokugaku, Motoori Norinaga, who would go on to found Ōyōmei-gaku or Wang Yangming School. There was criticism that his ideas were more in line with Buddhist teachings than Confucian teachings, but his ideas eventually became mainstream enough, and its position as a major Confucian school of thought solidified."
 ME_Ming_Events.2.a: "An excellent philosopher!"

 ME_Ming_Events.3.t: "The Miao Rebellions"
 ME_Ming_Events.3.d: "Although called the Miao rebellions, other minority tribes such as the Yao and subgroups like the Hmong participated in these rebellions. Their usual grievances were that they were being oppressed and extorted, and forced out of their lands by imperial officials sent to these areas. The heavy-handed quelling of these rebellions only served to enforce the tribes' hatred and encouraged further uprisings."
 ME_Ming_Events.3.a: "Damn."
 ME_Ming_Events.3.b: "Not again."

 ME_Ming_Events.4.t: "Tungning"
 ME_Ming_Events.4.desc: "One of our military officers was instrumental in pacifying the aborigines in the Taiwan area and chasing out barbarian traders. His unwavering support and loyalty for the Ming has resulted in him achieving a high rank and command of the local army. As he is an esteemed leader of the local population, they ask that he be made their leader. Perhaps we should consider having him serve as a loyal vassal?"
 ME_Ming_Events.4.a: "Indeed, the island would make a fine forward base."
 ME_Ming_Events.4.b: "We must reward our loyal vassals. Grant him the use of the imperial surname and the island as his personal fief."
 ME_Ming_Events.4.c: "The Emperor does not need powerful servants."
 ME_Ming_Events.4.d: "Treachery! Arrest him and have his conspirators executed!"
 ME_Ming_Events.4.e: "Kill him... quietly."

 ME_Ming_Events.5.t: "Palembang Revival"
 ME_Ming_Events.5.desc: "With the reconquest of the lands belonging to the Palembang Pacification Superintendency before its fall, our ships once again have a base to hunt pirates from in the South Sea. Should we reestablish the Superintendency?"
 ME_Ming_Events.5.a: "Yes. Reinstate the Shi dynasty."
 ME_Ming_Events.5.b: "Yes. Send one of our relatives to manage it."
 ME_Ming_Events.5.c: "No. We will rule it directly."
 ME_Ming_Events.5.d: "Yes. Put the Shis in charge."
 ME_Ming_Events.5.e: "No. Leave them to their own affairs."

 ME_Ming_Events.6.t: "Weird Animals for the Emperor"
 ME_Ming_Events.6.desc: "The discovery of the great size of the island in the south has given us much surprise. Even more surprising is the wonderful variety of animals present on the island. We should send them all to the Emperor, but which one should be considered the most prestigious?"
 ME_Ming_Events.6.a: "The one that the natives have informed us is called a "Kangaroo"."
 ME_Ming_Events.6.b: "That grey little bear hugging the tree!"
 ME_Ming_Events.6.c: "There's this spiky ant-eating creature that lays eggs..."
 ME_Ming_Events.6.d: "This duck here lays eggs too, but it suckles its young!"
 ME_Ming_Events.6.e: "How about the giant rat with square poop?"
 ME_Ming_Events.6.f: "We should get some of those big birds, they don't seem to be able to fly."
 ME_Ming_Events.6.g: "The screaming dogs would be nice if they would just pipe down..."
 ME_Ming_Events.6.h: "These little brown birds here look like those hairy fruits there."
 ME_Ming_Events.6.i: "Those lizards look really cool."
 ME_Ming_Events.6.j: "That giant bird there seems really rare, I haven't seen it anywhere else. Let's grab it."

 ME_Ming_Events.7.t: "The Zhengde Emperor"
 ME_Ming_Events.7.d: "One of the most controversial Emperors, the Zhengde Emperor, enacted tax and trade reforms, quelled the Prince of Ning rebellion, repulsed the Tatars and encouraged foreign studies, learning foreign languages himself. On the other hand, he favoured the corrupt "Eight Tiger" eunuchs, filled his harem to the point where some women died of starvation, involved himself in various religious ceremonies and generally fooled around. One later commentator described him as "being good at everything that had nothing to do with being Emperor". In all fairness, however, this may have been partially due to the bureaucratic deadlock faced by later Ming Emperors."
 ME_Ming_Events.7.a: "He shall be the next Emperor."
 ME_Ming_Events.7.b: "Preposterous!"

 ME_Ming_Events.8.t: "The Jiajing Emperor"
 ME_Ming_Events.8.d: "Not originally destined to take the throne, the Jiajing Emperor presided over many major events like the Great Rites Controversy and the Jiajing Earthquake. Although the initial part of his rule started well, he later took great interest in Taoism and spent more time practising rituals and attempting to become immortal than he did governing the country."
 ME_Ming_Events.8.a: "He shall be the next Emperor."
 ME_Ming_Events.8.b: "Preposterous!"

 ME_Ming_Events.9.t: "Great Rites Controversy"
 ME_Ming_Events.9.d: "As he was not the son of the previous Emperor, imperial protocol dictates that he recognises the previous Emperor as his adoptive father. However, the Jiajing Emperor was adamant that his biological father be recognised and given a place in the temples as an honorary emperor. Ministers and officials who opposed him were beaten and thrown into prison, while those who supported him were promoted. His eventual victory in this event paved the way for his future dictatorial ruling style."
 ME_Ming_Events.9.a: "It is only natural that the son loves his father."
 ME_Ming_Events.9.b: "We must stop the Emperor at all costs!"

 ME_Ming_Events.10.t: "Palace Women's Uprising"
 ME_Ming_Events.10.d: "Known as the "Daoist Emperor", there were many theories for the uprising. One was that alchemical concoctions that the Jiajing Emperor made to prolong his life required a substance made of the menstrual blood of virgins. Many young women were kept in the palace for this reason and were cruelly treated, leading to an intense hatred of the emperor. Another was that the Jiajing Emperor "longevity tortoise" died in the care of his concubines, who feared punishment. Finally, since there were so many women in his harem, lonely and spurned women turned their wrath on him. Either way, for the first and only time in Chinese history, palace maids and concubines conspired to strangle the reigning emperor to death in bed."
 ME_Ming_Events.10.a: "The Emperor has clearly lost the favour of Heaven."
 ME_Ming_Events.10.b: "Arrest the plotters!"

 ME_Ming_Events.11.t: "The Jiajing Earthquake"
 ME_Ming_Events.11.d: "The deadliest earthquake in recorded history, the Jiajing Earthquake, killed roughly 830,000 people and caused aftershocks for nearly half a year. Some counties lost up to 60% of their population and the property damage caused was so great that the Ming dynasty treasury was nearly empty for two years to support reconstruction."
 ME_Ming_Events.11.a: "Save the people."
 ME_Ming_Events.11.b: "Send only token support."

 ME_Ming_Events.12.t: "The Wanli Emperor"
 ME_Ming_Events.12.d: "As the longest-reigning Ming emperor, the beginning of his reign saw a revival of Ming fortunes. However, severe bureaucratic deadlock and restrictions by the literati combined with possible leg length inequality problems led to the emperor refusing to attend the Imperial Court for 28 years. His reign also saw the increased interaction between China and Europe and the rise of the Manchus. For some, his reign marked the beginning of the end for Ming."
 ME_Ming_Events.12.a: "He shall be the next Emperor."
 ME_Ming_Events.12.b: "Preposterous!"

 ME_Ming_Events.13.t: "Senior Grand Secretary Zhang"
 ME_Ming_Events.13.d: "Before the Wanli Emperor was old enough to rule by himself, the Shoufu, Zhang Jüzheng, acted as a de facto Prime Minister. He enacted reforms such as the Single Whip Law and cut down on the bloated bureaucracy. As a mentor to the young emperor, Zhang Jüzheng even dared to yell at him. His writings also served as the main reference for the Jesuits' Confucius Sinarum philosophus, a Latin translation of Confucian classics published in 1687 in Paris. His strictness and tendency to beat or suppress opposing officials led to him being greatly disliked, even by the emperor, leading to his posthumous punishment. His actions, however, did lead to a growth of national power before the emperor reversed most of his reforms."
 ME_Ming_Events.13.a: "An excellent minister!"

 ME_Ming_Events.14.t: "The Ningbo Incident"
 ME_Ming_Events.14.d: "The Ningbo Incident occurred when Japanese trading fleets from two different daimyo families arrived at Ningbo. The fleet carrying outdated tallies arrived later than the first but managed to be received first and received preferential treatment due to the use of bribes. This resulted in a dispute leading to the death of the commander of the second fleet and an investigation into the corruption by Chinese officials. The subsequent clampdown on trade led to increased piracy and smuggling."
 ME_Ming_Events.14.a: "Curses! Crush these pirates!"
 ME_Ming_Events.14.b: "Reopen trade with increased controls and better regulations."

 ME_Ming_Events.15.t: "Sea Cucumbers!"
 ME_Ming_Events.15.d: "It has come to our attention that in the recently captured area of Furdan, there is a small fishing village with a name along the lines of "Sea Cucumber Cliffs" in a bay called "Sea Cucumber Bay". The place is known for its sea cucumbers, and our naval officers would have suggested developing it as a port were it not for the fact that the water freezes over for nearly half the year."
 ME_Ming_Events.15.a: "Designate the village as a new centre of the sea cucumber industry."
 ME_Ming_Events.15.b: "Our ships could use a small supply port out there."

 ME_Ming_Events.16.t: "Mount Penglai"
 ME_Ming_Events.16.d: "When Qin Shi Huang sent Xu Fu to hunt for the elixir of life, he was supposed to search for Mount Penglai, where magical fruits that would grant eternal life when eaten grew. He was unsuccessful and ended up reaching Japan, where he named Mount Fuji as Mount Penglai instead. Apparently, he settled there and gave rise to the Japanese people. Mount Hanasan on Jizhou Island is unlikely to be the real Penglai, but claiming it as such could give us some much-needed development on the island."
 ME_Ming_Events.16.a: "Excellent. Let's see how much money we can make from gullible fools."
 ME_Ming_Events.16.b: "No one will fall for that. Use it for horse grazing like the Mongols did."
 ME_Ming_Events.16.c: "Make it a penal colony."

 ME_Ming_Events.17.t: "Lanfang Republic"
 ME_Ming_Events.17.desc: "The kongsi federations formed by Chinese miners on the western part of the island of Borneo have sent us a delegation petitioning the imperial court for autonomy as our recent conquest of the area has brought imperial administration there. Most of them are immigrants or local-born Chinese from our Hakka provinces. Should we grant it to them?"
 ME_Ming_Events.17.a: "They will have their autonomy in exchange for military support."
 ME_Ming_Events.17.b: "As long as they acknowledge our authority."
 ME_Ming_Events.17.c: "Just give them some financial support."
 ME_Ming_Events.17.d: "Nothing. They will follow the laws like everyone else."

 ME_Ming_Events.18.t: "Qilin!"
 ME_Ming_Events.18.d.1: "As a symbol of friendship, the ruler of Kilwa has presented us with a magnificent creature: a Qilin! The last time we received one was when Bengal presented us with one as tribute. To be in possession of one is a sure sign that the Mandate of Heaven is in the right hands!"
 ME_Ming_Events.18.d.2: "As a symbol of friendship, a tribal chieftain has presented us with a magnificent creature: a Qilin! The last time we received one was when Bengal presented us with one as tribute. To be in possession of one is a sure sign that the Mandate of Heaven is in the right hands!"
 ME_Ming_Events.18.a: "All hail the Emperor's new Qilin!"
 ME_Ming_Events.18.b: "Looks more like a long-necked deer to me..."

 ME_Ming_Events.19.t: "Wealth of Fusang"
 ME_Ming_Events.19.d: "The land of Fusang is rich and full of exotic goods that can be sent back to the Emperor. In fact, things that we consider to be luxury goods such as gold are abundant in such quantities that the natives do not seem to value them much and see them as normal, daily items. They are much more impressed by the horses and steel arms that we have. We could trade them for a low cost in return for large quantities of gold and local goods."
 ME_Ming_Events.19.a: "Excellent. Our profits will be substantial."
 ME_Ming_Events.19.b: "We will not stoop to the level of lowly merchants!"
 ME_Ming_Events.19.c: "Inform the natives that they are gifts from the gods and would require a much higher price than they think."

 ME_Ming_Events.20.t: "Tiangong Kaiwu"
 ME_Ming_Events.20.d: "The Tiangong Kaiwu, compiled by Song Yingxing, was a major encyclopaedic work on Chinese technology. Notably, it had numerous illustrations and did not reference past works, something unusual for the time. It provided an extremely valuable record of the technological progress at the time, covering diverse fields such as agriculture, pottery, paper-making and gunpowder weaponry."
 ME_Ming_Events.20.a: "We must use this work as a textbook and spread its knowledge to all parts of the Empire!"
 ME_Ming_Events.20.b: "This will be a handy reference when we need to improve our technology!"
 ME_Ming_Events.20.c: "I like the pictures, store it in my library."

 ME_Ming_Events.21.t: "Journey to the West"
 ME_Ming_Events.21.d: ""Your Majesty, what ability and what virtue does your poor monk possess that he should merit such affection from your Heavenly Grace? I shall not spare myself this journey, but I shall proceed with all diligence until I reach the Western Heaven. If I do not attain my goal, or the true scriptures, I shall not return to our land even if I have to die. I would rather fall into eternal perdition in Hell." --Xuanzang, Chapter 12\n\nBased on historical events and written by Wu Chengen, the Great Classical Novel, Journey to the West, described how the Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, went to India to visit Buddhist sites and obtain Buddhist scriptures. His return to China facilitated the flourishing of Buddhism and its subsequent spread in China and the rest of East Asia. In the novel, he is accompanied on his journey by three disciples, including a powerful monkey, a reliable but lazy pig person, and a river ogre. The events described are mostly mythical and is overall comedic in nature."
 ME_Ming_Events.21.a: "Marvelous."
 ME_Ming_Events.21.b: "I like the part about the pig."

 ME_Ming_Events.22.t: "The Red Chamber Dream"
 ME_Ming_Events.22.d: ""As petals drop and spring begins to fail,\nThe bloom of youth, too, sickens and turns pale.\nOne day, when spring has gone, and youth has fled,\nThe Maiden and the flowers will both be dead." --Chapter 27\n\nConsidered the greatest of the Four Great Classical Novels, it replaced Jin Ping Mei in the original list, so great was its prose. Said to be the tragedy of tragedies, the story revolves around the rise and fall of the Jia family, with Jia Baoyü being the main protagonist alongside a huge cast of major land minor characters. The real focus of the novel, however, is on the women in the household, where Baoyü is seemingly a mere onlooker as they slowly descend towards a doomed fate. Wordplay and poetry are heavily used in the novel, not just as literature but also as hints to the future tragic fates of the characters. The allure of the novel is only added to as only the first 80 chapters by Cao Xueqin were preserved, with the remaining 40 being added by a second author."
 ME_Ming_Events.22.a: "Fascinating."
 ME_Ming_Events.22.b: "It's too tragic for me. He's a great writer though."

 ME_Ming_Events.23.t: "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"
 ME_Ming_Events.23.d: ""The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been." --Chapter 1\n\nThe must-read Great Classical Novel for all boys aspiring to be real men. The novel is based on the historical events during the Three Kingdoms period where Wei, Wu and Shu split the land in three. Luo Guanzhong changed the narrative to be heavily pro-Shu and anti-Wei however; romanticising and glorifying many of the characters on the Shu side. Besides the 1000 or so mostly historical cast of characters, the political subterfuge and deceptive tricks are so dramatically described that it has continued to be loved by so many till this day."
 ME_Ming_Events.23.a: "Epic."
 ME_Ming_Events.23.b: "I like this Diao Chan girl more..."

 ME_Ming_Events.24.t: "Outlaws of the Marsh"
 ME_Ming_Events.24.d: ""Within the bounds of the four seas, all men are brothers." --Chapter 44\n\nPossibly written by Shi Naian and revised by Luo Guanzhong, the second of the Four Great Classical Novels, Outlaws of the Marsh describes how 108 outlaws gather at Liangshan Marsh and form a sizable army before being granted amnesty and called in to resist invaders and suppress rebels. Although a work of fiction, scenes involving the characters performing extraordinary feats like killing tigers and uprooting a tree with his bare hands alone are very memorable, and the novel would also be the base for the erotic novel Jin Ping Mei."
 ME_Ming_Events.24.a: "Inspiring."
 ME_Ming_Events.24.b: "I just feel like punching a corrupt official."

 ME_Ming_Events.25.t: "Wanli's Three Campaigns"
 ME_Ming_Events.25.d: "Between 1592 and 1600, the Wanli Emperor carried out three successful major campaigns. The Ningxia and Bozhou campaigns against rebels, and the Chaoxian campaign against Japanese invasions of Korea (for which he is remembered by the Koreans). Though successful, the campaigns drained the Ming coffers and led to further decline. However, the Chaoxian campaign was influential in the decision of the Yi dynasty to not recognize Qing suzerainty after Beijing had fallen."
 ME_Ming_Events.25.a: "Crush them all!"

 ME_Ming_Events.26.t: "Question of the Crown Prince"
 ME_Ming_Events.26.d: "The Wanli Emperor's first-born son, Changluo, was the son of a palace maid. As such, he favoured making the son of his favourite concubine, Changxun, Crown Prince instead. This resulted in a struggle between the factions, with the Empress Dowager and most ministers supporting the firstborn. Changluo was eventually made Crown Prince, but only after an assassination attempt on his life was his position secured. Unfortunately, he died after 39 days on the throne. Changxun's fate was no better, apparently being killed and eaten during Li Zicheng's rebellion."
 ME_Ming_Events.26.a: "Have the Empress Dowager remind the emperor that he is the son of a palace maid too."
 ME_Ming_Events.26.b: "Forget primogeniture. Let the Emperor choose his heir!"
 ME_Ming_Events.26.c: "Why not choose another son?"
