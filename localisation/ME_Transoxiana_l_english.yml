 transoxiana_beijing_samarkand_pact_title: "Relations with China"
 transoxiana_beijing_samarkand_pact_desc: "We've been a close trade partner with the Chinese Emperors for ages. It is time to make our relationship flourish more than ever by sending a eunuch to the celestial court and offering them a trading agreement that would bring mutual benefit to the both states."

 transoxiana_benefits_from_the_silk_trade_title: "Benefits of the Silk Trade"
 transoxiana_benefits_from_the_silk_trade_desc: "The Silk Trade is one of the driving factors of our economy. Countless traders travel through the famous route every day and bring with them the famed goods of China. If we pursue a policy of building marketplaces as well as supporting the traders, we will bring long-term benefits to the state."

 transoxiana_caspian_satrapies_title: "The Caspian Satrapies"
 transoxiana_caspian_satrapies_desc: "In the current state of affairs, the Caspian Satrapies remain out of Timurid Influence. Once subjugated by Timur, they shall be brought under our rule again. It is time to end the pathetic independence of the Caspians and exploit their trading cities for our own good."

 transoxiana_fall_of_the_timurids_title: "Fall of the Empire"
 transoxiana_fall_of_the_timurids_desc: "The Timurid Empire was once thriving under the rule of Timur. Unfortunately, ever since he perished, his state would come under rule of weak emperors who would end the splendor of the Timurid State. With the death of Shah Rukh, the beloved father of Ulugh Beg, the empire is in shambles. It's high time we bring an end to its suffering and acquire our inheritance." 

 transoxiana_centre_of_the_silk_trade_title: "Center of the Silk Trade"
 transoxiana_centre_of_the_silk_trade_desc: "In 1370, Timur made Samarkand his capital. Since then, Samarkand has been enjoying a time of renewed prosperity and has stayed a center of not only silk trade, but also of arts and research. The city on the rock shall thrive further!"

 transoxiana_deal_with_khorasan_desc: "Babur bin Baysunkur of the Timurid Dynasty is one of the most rowdy and powerful contestants to the Timurid Throne. Furthermore, our rivalry has demonstrated itself in various skirmishes and conflicts between us. It is time to deal with Babur once for all! There is only one heir of Shah Rukh and that is Ulugh Beg!"

 transoxiana_reintegrate_the_governor_of_qom_title: "Re-Integrating the Traitor"
 transoxiana_reintegrate_the_governor_of_qom_desc: "With Babur handled, it is time to end the rule of the descendants of Muhammad bin Baysonqor - one of the rebels to Shah Rukh's rule and certainly an indirect cause to his death. By rebelling, he brought shame upon his branch of the family and his posessions should now be reintegrated into the proper Timurid Empire."

 transoxiana_usurp_the_throne_title: "Usurp the Throne"
 transoxiana_usurp_the_throne_desc: "With beloved Shah Rukh dead and his illegitimate heir removed from the Timurid Throne, it's time for Ulugh Beg to usurp his rightful position as the new Timurid Emperor. Originally given to Ulugh Beg, the title of heir to the Timurid Empire was unjustly snapped up by Ala al-Dawla Abd Allah Timurid. Fortunately, his rule is now over and the Timurid Scepter may soon lie in the hands of Ulugh Beg."

 transoxiana_timurs_heir_title: "Timur's Heir"
 transoxiana_timurs_heir_desc: "After countless wars and seemingly endless bloodshed, our Timurid branch has finally come on top. The fake contenders to Timur's empire have finally been swept off the Persian Fields, and we lie as the sole successors to it. It is time for the final push to glory!"

 transoxiana_rival_the_hordes_title: "Taming the Hordes"
 transoxiana_rival_the_hordes_desc: "Rule over Mavarannahr brings great power, but with it comes the great danger. Indoubtedly, we are the buffer state between the heart of the Empire and the wicked hordes of the north that are looking for an opportunity to sack the thriving cities of Samarkand and Herat. These vile nomads must be dealt with. "

 transoxiana_adopt_turkoman_tactics_title: "Turkoman Tactics"
 transoxiana_adopt_turkoman_tactics_desc: "While we have been using the infamous 'Hit and Run' tactics for ages, the traditional Turkoman tactic has been falling out of use recently. We should perfect the tactics instead."

 transoxiana_subjucate_afghanistan_title: "A Letter to Afghanistan"
 transoxiana_subjucate_afghanistan_desc: "The Sheikhdom of Afghanistan is placed in a highly strategic position. The current Sheikh ruling in Kabul is nothing but a mere impostor of a ruler. Let us send an offer to the Afghani Monarch offering him vassalization, if he accepts, we will recognize him as a worthy ruler and that we will protect them in his hardships."

 transoxiana_reclaim_sistan_title: "Reclamation of Sistan"
 transoxiana_reclaim_sistan_desc: "Sistan has always been part of Timur's Empire. However, since the fall of Herat and the imminent collapse of the Timurid Administration, the Mihrabanids have been free from the shackles. It is time to restore the Timurid rule over Sistan."

 transoxiana_arrival_of_abu_said_title: "The Arrival of Abu Sa'id"

 transoxiana_a_possible_traitor_title: "A Possible Traitor?"
 transoxiana_a_possible_traitor_desc: "Abu Sa'id Mirza, though a person of great help in the court and a skilled instructor, is also of great danger to the state. Word has reached [Root.Monarch.GetName] that he is planning to raise the banner of rebellion and use the Afghani tribesmen to storm Samarkand. We shall tread carefully and be ready to supress any rebellion, providing gossips are true."

 transoxiana_suleymans_range_fortifications_title: "Mountain Fortifications"
 transoxiana_suleymans_range_fortifications_desc: "As it currently stands, our eastern flank is frequently getting raided by minor Indian Chiefs. This must stop! To protect us from being attacked in times of need, we shall construct forts on the border with India, little price to pay for salvation. "
