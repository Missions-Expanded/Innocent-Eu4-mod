 # Events:
 ME_Cologne_Events.1.t: "Move the capital"
 ME_Cologne_Events.1.d: "The Archbishop was captured by enemy forces in the Battle of Worringen in 1288 and the condition to release him was to grant near-complete autonomy to the city of Cologne. The citizens of Cologne have recently put this issue forward again and want us out. An option is to move the capital away from Cologne."
 ME_Cologne_Events.1.a: "We can keep the capital in Cologne"
 ME_Cologne_Events.1.b: "Bonn is nearby and suited as capital"
 ME_Cologne_Events.1.c: "Arnsberg looks nice too"
 ME_Cologne_Events.2.t: "The Cologne Cathedral"
 ME_Cologne_Events.2.d: "The Cologne Cathedral has been under construction since 1248. It houses the relics of the Three Wise Men, the bones of the three men that came to visit baby Jesus when he was born. Do we have the funds to continue this construction?"

 ME_Cologne_Events.2.b: "No, stop the construction"

 ME_Cologne_Events.3.t: "The Soest Feud"
 ME_Cologne_Events.3.d: "At the beginning of the 15th century it was obvious that the Bishops wouldn't be able to keep the state together. The Unrest in the Westphalian cities was becoming more and more visible up to the point when it was obvious a conflict would break out. And so, several months ago, in the June of 1444, the town of Soest had the gall to formally declare the duke of Cleves-Mark as their new suzerain thus attempting to break off from the state of Cologne. The attempt was of course noticed and a Feud broke out. Up until know, the skirmishing was indecisive, but there exists a risk that the Feud might become a full fledged rebellion."
 ME_Cologne_Events.3.a: "The Rebellion must be put down!"
 ME_Cologne_Events.3.b: "We will have to give up our lands in Westphalia"
 ME_Cologne_Events.4.t: "Aftermath of the Feud"

Now, a city that rebelled against us is at our mercy. A city in despair, almost crushed by the Bishop's army. What shall we do with the town?"
