 sic_holy_see_desc: "It seems funny that the current Pope has shown interest in not remaining Neutral and instead has started meddling into our political life, it's time to appoint another Pope, a Pope that will surely be more kin with our political view and will not put his nose into the mortal affairs, the Cardinal della Rovere will surely be more fit to the job."

 sic_isle_of_malta_title: "Màuta"
 sic_isle_of_malta_desc: "The island fell in 870 under the rule of the Arabs, who eliminated almost all the original inhabitants and repopulated the archipelago, building the new capital Mdina on the site of the previous Roman city of Melita. The new rulers introduced the cultivation of cedar and cotton, built an irrigation system and, in particular, the Arabic language, which most of the population adopted as their mother tongue. Its influence in modern Maltese is easily found, as well as the presence of words of Latin origin and of the Latin alphabet. The Arab domination lasted for about two centuries, from 870 to 1091, during which Islam became the main religion on the island (although Christians were allowed to practice their worship). \nThe period of Arab domination ended in 1091 when the island was conquered by the Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily, at the helm of Ruggero d'Altavilla. The archipelago thus entered the Sicilian orbit, and was placed under the control of the members of the Norman house of Sicily, although in fact it was a little more than nominal control. In 1191 Margarito of Brindisi landed again on the island and was appointed first count of Malta. The ties of the island with Sicily consequently became ever closer, and the fiefdom was subsequently granted to the families of the highest Sicilian nobility."

To generate the episode was the reaction to the gesture of a soldier of the Aragonese army, such Drouet, who had turned disrespectfully to a young noblewoman accompanied by his wife, putting his hands on her on the pretext of having to search her. In defense of his wife, the groom managed to steal the sword from the soldier and kill him. This gesture constituted the spark that started the revolt. In the course of the evening and the night that followed the people of Palermo - with the cry of "Mora, mora!" - they indulged in a real "hunt for the Aragonese" which quickly spread throughout the island, becoming a carnage. The few Aragonese who survived the massacre succeeded in taking refuge in their ships, moored along the coast."

 sic_blooming_art_title: "Blooming Art"
 sic_blooming_art_desc: "The beginning of the fifteenth century is characterized in Sicily by the Franco-Provençal and Pisan-Sienese influence on artistic figurative culture which finds its maximum expression in the fresco of the masterpiece of the Triumph of late Gothic death. The greatest artists of the period are Gaspare da Pesaro and his son Guglielmo Pesaro. \nIn architecture, the intense construction activity is characterized by its adherence to late Gothic forms with the Iberian mark (especially in the Val di Noto), and by the persistence of decorations and planimetric motifs that have been repeated since the Norman era. \nPalermo and Messina, among the main cities, went through a phase of demographic and economic growth in the fifteenth century thanks to the presence of the port and numerous communities of Pisan, Venetian, Lombard and Genoese merchants. Even the social structure of the city was renewed with a class of officials and merchants who joined the nobility by building noble palaces and chapels and requesting refined artifacts of great value. \nThese premises, thanks to the arrival of numerous artists of the peninsula and the influence of the Neapolitan artistic environment of the Alfonso II period, allowed the renewal of the artistic language in Sicily."

The first king of Sicily in fact received royal dignity from the sanction of Parliament, and the event imposed the canon - albeit unencoded - for which all subsequent rulers of the Kingdom of Sicily alternating on the throne were to obtain assent (more than approval) of Parliament."

Thus the Romans conquered the city, latinizing its name in Drepanum. \nAfter the Romans, the Vandals, then the Byzantines dominated the city, but it was in the 9th century AD. with the Arabs (who called it Itràbinis, Taràbanis, Tràpanesch) and with the Normans (who conquered it in 1077 led by Roger I) that the city reached a fervent development, thriving in trade and cultural activities, so the port had great turmoil also thanks to the crusades. The port of Trapani, during the Middle Ages, was one of the most important in the Mediterranean: all the most powerful seaside cities (Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Amalfi) had a consulate in the Trapani port and, especially with the first two, Trapani had the agreement to act as a stopover for their possessions in North Africa. \nIn 1266 the Venetian and Genoese fleets collided in front of the port of Trapani during the San Saba war. The Venetians captured the entire Genoese fleet. \nAfter a short period under the Angevins, Trapani actively participated in the uprising of the Sicilian Vespers led by Palmiero Abate, passing to the Aragonese in 1282. During the 14th and 15th centuries the city grew and became the most economically and politically important center of western Sicily. In 1443, from simple Earth it became Civitas.

 ME_Sicily_Events.2.T: "Sicilian Renaissance"
 ME_Sicily_Events.2.D: "The gigantic figure in the cultural landscape of the early Renaissance in Sicily is Antonello da Messina who with his complex formation between Naples, Venice and Flanders demonstrates the circulation of ideas that characterized the era. His works for the commissions of the island and his definitive return home represented the first affirmation of Renaissance painting on the island, thanks to a crowded laboratory that introduced the new taste for the human figure, the pictorial genre of the portrait into traditional production. and a new role of the artist are no longer just an anonymous craftsman. \nAmong the most interesting artists active in Messina Giorgio da Milano, Andrea Mancino, Bernardino Nobile and the Carrarese Giovan Battista Mazzolo, owner of an important workshop, which was joined by Messina Antonio Freri (also active in Catania), without count the presence of Antonello Gagini, son of Domenico, in Messina. As in Palermo, these Tuscan and Lombard artists brought in the city and its surroundings to Calabria, the rich repertoire of classicist architectural decorations. However, throughout the fifteenth century, despite some obsolete interpretations, the architecture continued to follow the late Gothic tradition despite the presence of Renaissance decorative episodes. \nThe renewal of language therefore did not immediately involve the entire building organization. The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers. In addition to the few traces left by Laurana, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Renaissance language can be found only in minor episodes such as the Ventimiglia chapel in the church of San Francesco in Castelbuono."

The Templar possessions were organized into eight \"Languages\" (Auvergne, Aragon, Castile, France, Germany, England, Italy and Provence). Once in Rhodes, and now known as the Knights of Rhodes, they were forced to develop above all the military side of their business, engaging above all against the Berber corsairs. During the 15th century, the Hospitallers victoriously opposed two invasion attempts: one in 1440 by the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, the second in 1480 by the Ottoman sultan Muhammad II, who, after the fall of Constantinople saw one of his main enemies in the Knights of the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem. \nEscaping and trying to rebuilding a crusading fortress in the east they asked for the island of Malta to be their new starting ground."

Apart from the garrisons in the African towns, and apart from the use of Norman-style cavalry charges, evidence for the presence of 'Norman' or 'Frankish' characteristics cannot be found.
