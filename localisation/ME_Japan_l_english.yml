 jap_rice_broker_desc: "As urbanization and other economic shifts became significantly widespread and powerful in the 14th century, the growth of towns created a growth in demand for the transport of produce, particularly rice, into the towns, from increasingly larger and further rural areas. As a result, a system of material transport and warehousing in Kyoto emerged.

The cost of all this would bankrupt all but the wealthiest lords, preventing them from accumulating the funds they would need to maintain a private army. It would also help bolster our own power in the capital, and make it a far more attractive place for courtiers and diplomats."

And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea - whether it is to sail or to watch it - we are going back from whence we came."

I can only have a man who will leap into the water, not minding the damn fish and whatever other little things that scare him.
