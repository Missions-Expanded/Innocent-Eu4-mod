 # Events:
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME1: "A New Favored Class?"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC1: "We are no strangers to favors and benefits. Despite the decent performance of our current system, we have the ability to promote a single class and coordinate with it throughout [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign ensuing not only their loyalty but also a variety of back-and-forth quid pro quos. Even though many advocate against such a policy, there is certainly some merit to at least consider it."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT1: "Let us promote the Samurai."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT2: "We should discuss business with the Merchants."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT3: "Let us turn to the religious heads."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT4: "No quid pro quo!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME3: "Period of Growth"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC3: "The dawn of a new age of stability saw [Root.GetName] prospering and expanding its population. Private schools, the issuing of new coinage and the growth of literacy and commerce all contributed to what later historians dubbed 'the developing sense of elegance and refinement of [Root.GetName]'. As such, it is now that we are called up to decide how we will guide our prestigious Empire to greater highs."
 ME_Japan_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Let us focus on conquest."
 ME_Japan_Events3.EVTOPT2: "The future rests in our maritime endeavours."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME4: "The Meiji Restoration"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC4: "A period later dubbed 'Meiji Restoration' gripped Japan during the Age of Revolutions. Times of instability, warring factions and Daimyo at arms, split into two camps. Those loyal to the Emperor, favoring innovativeness and western influences versus those in favor of the Shogun, and his manifesto of traditional values and seclusion. A fascinating crossroads of history in our time."
 ME_Japan_Events4.EVTOPT1: "These are dark times."

 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME5: "The End of the Meiji Restoration"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC5: "Years of instability have taken a heavy toll on our lands. Crops fed with the blood of our brothers whilst our cattle die of hunger. Families broken and communities lay shattered while houses and entire neighborhoods are nothing but a smoldering ashe and a pile of memories. What horrors or joys the future may hold, none dare imagine. A blood moon looms over Japan and the atrocities have ceased. Let us put these dark times behind us , as we delve into the unknown depths of the future with our heads held up high."
 ME_Japan_Events5.EVTOPT1: "The worst is behind you, brother."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME6: "Daimyo Lords Demand Autonomy"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC6: "As the rebellion rages on and the Emperor clashes with the Shogun in the open, the puny Daimyo Lords under our rule found our weakest time to demand more influence and autonomy. Such cutthroat diplomacy is evidence of their collaboration withe the enemy but nevertheless we need them on our side."
 ME_Japan_Events6.EVTOPT1: "A few concessions for the greater good."
 ME_Japan_Events6.EVTOPT2: "They answer to me!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME7: "Open Rebellion of [GetYear]"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC7: "Alas, the peasants have realized the dire situation in which our rule currently resides and have decided to take up arms, demanding a better social status and income. This is truly the beginning of the end for [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 ME_Japan_Events7.EVTOPT1: "We will listen to their plight."
 ME_Japan_Events7.EVTOPT2: "They will learn to fear me!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME8: "Shiroyama"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC8: "As the Meiji Restoration crisis rages on, a band of noble elite samurai makes a last stand against the forces of modernization. Their Lord, a remnant of the past and the continuation of centuries of tradition, or a detached relic and a fool. Whatever our opinion of him and his men is, they certainly made a name for themselves simply by exhibiting the utmost bravery and honor in the face of death and dispair. This is a showdown for the ages, the sword faces the gun."
 ME_Japan_Events8.EVTOPT1: "Let us side with the samurai!"
 ME_Japan_Events8.EVTOPT2: "Surround and outnumber them!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME9: "Speech of Victory"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC9: "... I do need the Westerners. And their backing. Would you like to know why? 'I have a dream. That one day, every person in this nation will control their own destiny. A landof the truly free. A nation of ACTION, not words. Ruled by STRENGTH, not committee or foreigners. Where the law changes to suit the individual, not the other way around. Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself! To hell with all the bureaucrats and outsiders who poison our minds. To hell with this daily spew of trivialities. To hell with tradition and modernization. To hell with the Europeans! All of them! Japan is diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving it - we need to pull it out by the roots. WIpe the slate clean. Burn it down! And from the ashes, a new Japan will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged, and the strongest will thrive - free to live as they see fit, they will make Japan GREAT AGAIN! Please understand. I'm using war as a business to get the throne... so I can end war as a business! In my new Japan, people will die and kill for what they believe! Not for money, not for coal! Not for what they're told is right. Every man will be free to fight his own wars!'"
 ME_Japan_Events9.EVTOPT1: "... thus spoke [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Japan_Events9.EVTOPT2: "... signed, Emperor Meiji, [GetYear]."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME10: "The Khan's Rebellion"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC10: "Years of rebellion and harsh treatment have accumulated to the resentment of our subjects in Manchuria. Despite our best efforts to quell their separatist sentiment, our temporary weakness seems to have emboldened them to demand more rights and autonomy! They should be punished as misbehaving children and be reminded of who they serve!"
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT1: "We will grant them autonomy!"
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT2: "Let them defect, for all we care!"
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT3: "We had no use of them anyway."
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT4: "They shall taste the boot."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME11: "The Joseon Rebellion"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC11: "Years of rebellion and harsh treatment have accumulated to the resentment of our subjects in Korea. Despite our best efforts to quell their separatist sentiment, our temporary weakness seems to have emboldened them to demand more rights and autonomy! They should be punished as misbehaving children and be reminded of who they serve!"
 ME_Japan_Events11.EVTOPT1: "We will grant them autonomy!"
 ME_Japan_Events11.EVTOPT2: "Let them defect, for all we care!"
 ME_Japan_Events11.EVTOPT3: "We had no use of them anyway."
 ME_Japan_Events11.EVTOPT4: "They shall taste the boot."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME12: "Successors of Krung Tai"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC12: "Once a powerful Kingdom, adorned with gold and gems as far as the eye can see, now lies in ruins. In its stead, the [Root.GetAdjective] Empire, our proudest military advisors have devised a plan to overtake the entire region as peacefully as possible. A member of the last Prasat Thong dynasty wishes to press his claim onto the entire region in exchange of the Chrysanthemum Throne. Whilst this move would definitely upset our people, it would essentially legitimize further conquest in the old region."
 ME_Japan_Events12.EVTOPT1: "The throne is his."
 ME_Japan_Events12.EVTOPT2: "Let us just celebrate our conquest!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME13: "Declawing the Tiger"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC13: "To administer the beautifully intellectual courts of Japan and Edo is easy, as our administrators point out. Whatever deceit happens is usually elegant and purposeful. The same cannot be said of our subjects in Manchuria. These ill-mannered brutes who know not of etiquette and administration have proved to be quite a handful for our local governors. The local officials have time and again asked for the Imperial Guard to intervene and crush riots whilst these horse-loving savages dare to demand independence. How will [Root.Monarch.GetName] handle this?"
 ME_Japan_Events13.EVTOPT1: "Send a message."
 ME_Japan_Events13.EVTOPT2: "We shall grant some autonomy."
 ME_Japan_Events13.EVTOPT3: "Some radical reforms are in order."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME14: "Campaign into South China"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC14: "Months of planning, years of relentless training and days spent adjusting our organization strategies have culminated in this moment. The final decision of the execution of such a grand campaign rests on the shoulders of [Root.Monarch.Name]. We may approach the Chinese continent by sea, blockade their ports and invade their coasts on multiple points. We can however also raze through their land with incredible speed and ferocity, stunning them as we march through their countryside. Let our plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when we move, fall like a thunderbolt."
 ME_Japan_Events14.EVTOPT1: "We shall invade by the sea!"
 ME_Japan_Events14.EVTOPT2: "We shall march to their capital!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME15: "Fate of the Emperorship"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC15: "As the last bastion of [emperor_of_china.GetName] falls to anarchy and violence, the people look upon our enlightened Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] for guidance. What shall be the fate of the Crown?"
 ME_Japan_Events15.EVTOPT1: "One Crown to Rule them All and in the Light Guide Them."
 ME_Japan_Events15.EVTOPT2: "Their crown belongs with their last Emperor, dead and forgotten."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME16: "Of Spice and Herbs"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC16: "Advisors, scholars, poets and even politicians have all taken part on the latest grand debate that's shaking the nation. Unlike the usual grim matters of war or poverty that afflict and take up the desks of our hierarchy, lately the question on everyone's mind is: Spice or Herbs? Certainly both sides have strong arguements for their case. Spices definitely have the extra flavor to make our food and drink have that special taste and kick whilst the tea and other herbs dutifully posess their healing as well as calming properties which have been with our nation for centuries."
 ME_Japan_Events16.EVTOPT1: "I love me some spice ..."
 ME_Japan_Events16.EVTOPT2: "... but herbs is where it's at!"

 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME17: "The Colonial Menace"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC17: "Tales of wealth beyond one's imagination, lush exotic women and unclaimed lands as far as the eye can see are but a few reports that our explorers have brought back from their discoveries. With a new virgin continent, waiting to be taken, we need only reach out and claim it as our own. This new land, America, will be ours. Let it support and contribute to our ever expanding maritime Empire!"
 ME_Japan_Events17.EVTOPT1: "Let us claim their wealth."
 ME_Japan_Events17.EVTOPT2: "We should try to co-exist."
 ME_Japan_Events17.EVTOPT3: "Send an embassy to trade with them."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME18: "[Root.GetAdjective] Colonial Code"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC18: "Administrating a Kingdom is difficult. Administrating a vast Naval Empire, however, is on a whole other level. In order to avoid being overwhelmed under all this bureaucracy and properly rein in our colonial subjects, we should assure our advisors and local governors by directly funding their efforts to control our overseas conquests and funnel more and better people as time goes by."
 ME_Japan_Events18.EVTOPT1: "Some financial aid is in order."
 ME_Japan_Events18.EVTOPT2: "Allow the Expanded Colonial Code."
 ME_Japan_Events18.EVTOPT3: "They're on their own."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME20: "[Root.GetAdjective] Colonial Era"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC20: "New horizons, shores, goods and extraordinary foreigners have shaken up our worldview. As we sail further and further we realize that we are indeed part of a vast land, home to all kinds of peculiar and interesting folk. From the lush jungles of Java and Malacca, to the shores of what later became known as America, we pioneer at the forefront of colonial innovativeness. \n\nA brave new frontier. \nColonized by the bold ..."
 ME_Japan_Events20.EVTOPT1: "... boldly mapping the new shores."
 ME_Japan_Events20.EVTOPT2: "... carving a route to wealth."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME21: "Colonial Ventures of [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC21: "The common folk and sea dogs of our Empire's Navy seem to speak of a far away shore with people of color and strange customs. Rumors of lands with gold, cotton and new trade goods like tobacco have reached [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The fervor of expedition and discovery is at its peak as we get ready to traverse this new land and unravel its mysteries, a new continent lays bare for us to tame. We should move forward and fund more expeditions as well as voyages into the great unknown!"
 ME_Japan_Events21.EVTOPT1: "Let us fund these expeditions!"
 ME_Japan_Events21.EVTOPT2: "This is not the time for such frivolous spending."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME22: "The Great Age of Pirates"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC22: "For far too long we have pained ourselves with dealing against pirate scum and the looming chinese dragon above our heads. For far too long we have been fed the lie.Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous? These terms have always changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand at the top determine what's wrong and what's right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins the war becomes justice! We should forge our own truth and play by our rules, carve our own destiny, no matter what our neighbors and foes wish of us!"
 ME_Japan_Events22.EVTOPT1: "I will be ... the Pirate King!"
 ME_Japan_Events22.EVTOPT2: "We are better than that!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME23: "Heavenly Approval"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC23: "Despite our just conquest of the Great Ming and the title of 'Emperor of China' under our benevolent rulers, the peasants still do not see us as legitimate beholders of the Mandate of Heaven. Having been the first of many Empires to sit on this magnificent throne, we should learn from our history and not repeat their mistakes, lest we risk invoking the wrath of our Heavenly hosts. For that purpose, a bold proposal has reached our bureaucratic council: the funding of monuments at key districts around our cities, dedicated to prosperity and Heaven itself, in order to secure Its favor."
 ME_Japan_Events23.EVTOPT1: "A capital idea!"
 ME_Japan_Events23.EVTOPT2: "The peasants are uppity."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME25: "A Dynastic House of Cards"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC25: "Famines, droughts and peasant uprisings have all but helped calm the situation whilst the war between us and the Chinese Emperor rages on. Such instability is evidence that their inner political situation has reached the absolute breaking point. Perhaps this war will be the drop that will split China, ending the era of the Ming. Should we capture Beijing and sow discontent through their population through compelling military victories against them, the Heavens are surely to enact swift justice upon the failed Ming Emperor."
 ME_Japan_Events25.EVTOPT1: "Witness the death of an Empire, the death of an Era."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME26: "End of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC26: "Some time has passed since the [From.GetAdjective] occupation of [Root.Capital.GetName]. The people rioted, rose up and demanded the death of what was later deemed to be, the final Emperor of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. The wind of change blows straight into the face of time like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell for peace of mind all across the realm of the fallen Empire. What tomorrow holds in store we do not know but the dawn of a new epoch. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."
 ME_Japan_Events26.EVTOPT1: "Listen to the wind of change."

 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME27: "The First Geisha"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC27: "A Geisha (or Geiko) is a person of arts, essentially a performing female artist. As coin poured into the treasuries of Japan, a growing part of it was funneled into culture and entertainment. The first female artists performed erotic dances and skits, and this new art was dubbed kabuku, meaning 'to be wild and outrageous'. The dances were called 'kabuki' and this was the beginning of Kabuki theater. Eventually it resulted in the birth of the first Geisha, Kikuya, who carved the definition of the modern Geisha, an elegant artist, almost divine artist of dance and song of unparalleled manners and grace."
 ME_Japan_Events27.EVTOPT1: "Such refinement and sophistication!"

 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME28: "Poetry and Songs of the Edo Period"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC28: "The Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments and cultural maturation, especially in terms of theater, music, and other entertainment. For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-chō was invented during this time and is still used today in folk songs. Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened. In its original form, ryūka were poems and songs to be sung with sanshin, a banjo-like instrument, rather than poems to be read aloud. \n\n§BOur pillows side-by-side; \nthe heartlessness of my dreams. \nThe moon sets in the west \nalone in a bed for two.§!"
 ME_Japan_Events28.EVTOPT1: "What a display of beauty and intellect."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME29: "Way of Chonindo"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC29: "Chonindo is a distinct culture that arose in cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido (way of the warrior) qualities—diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality—while blending Shinto, Neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts. For the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture."
 ME_Japan_Events29.EVTOPT1: "What a time to be alive!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME30: "Rangaku"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC30: "Originally a body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave of Dejima, which allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western technology and medicine in Edo Period, the study of Western advances assisted and boosted the progress of Japanese knowledge. In time, the Shogun and the many Lords under him towered over their derelict and declining counterparts, mainly because of this western lifeline of knowledge."
 ME_Japan_Events30.EVTOPT1: "For Science!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME31: "Great Fire of Meireki"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC31: "Started by a priest who allegedly was attempting to burn a cursed kimono, the Great Fire of Meireki decimated [1028.GetName] and claimed over 100,000 lives. Due to the nature of the buildings in [1028.GetName], which are made of wood and paper, the fire that started in the Hongo District quickly sread throughout the city. Sadly, the fact that we chose to construct our buildings so close to one another played a significant part in the fast spread of the fiery destruction."
 ME_Japan_Events31.EVTOPT1: "What a tragedy."

 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME32: "The Power of Symbols"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC32: "For centuries Daimyo Lords fought one another over the vital city of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Hordes of Samurai and aspiring generals held onto it, attempting to reign in the other vassal Lords, many to no avail, often leading to bloodshed and senseless killing. Since the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName] signals the beggining of a new period of tranquility, growth and prosperity, we should consider transferring our capital to Edo, as a symbol of a fresh start and centralized political power."
 ME_Japan_Events32.EVTOPT1: "Let it be Edo!"
 ME_Japan_Events32.EVTOPT2: "We shall stay in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME33: "Gokaido Stations"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC33: "Since the construction of the Five Routes, also known as 'Gokaido', traffic as well as mobilization and coin has been abundant in the areas that the roads envelop. As a result, some of our advisors have come up with the idea of Shukuba, a large number of Post Stations dedicated to ensuring rest for the travellers as well as the safety of the goods they transported. Such an expansion, whilst costly, will certainly have a great impact on the locals and our trade."
 ME_Japan_Events33.EVTOPT1: "Let us fund the Post Stations!"
 ME_Japan_Events33.EVTOPT2: "This money is best spent elsewhere."
 ME_Japan_Events33.EVTOPT3: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will handle this!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME34: "Keian Uprising"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC34: "What started as a large number of disgruntled Ronin, evolved in a full on coup d'etat spearheaded by the military strategist Yui Shosetsu and the Ronin Murabashi Chuya. Whilst their call to arms was imminent and their bargaining hand strong, they demand the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] abdicate the throne peacefully, lest we ensue chaos and bloodshed."
 ME_Japan_Events34.EVTOPT1: "We must comply for the good of the realm."
 ME_Japan_Events34.EVTOPT2: "If it's a fight they want ..."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME35: "The San Felipe Incident"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC35: "While [Root.GetName] was first coming in contact with Christianity, one of the Spanish vessels, San Felipe shipwrecked in Urado on the Japanese island of Shikoku en route from Manila to Acapulco. The local Lord was informed by the ship's captain that the 26 missionaries on board were part of the standard procedure of the Spanish to send missionaries before an invasion. The matter escalated so much that it even reached [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Japan_Events35.EVTOPT1: "Crucify them."
 ME_Japan_Events35.EVTOPT2: "Nonesense, they are men of the cloth!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME36: "The Separation Edict"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC36: "Seeing as though the [Root.GetAdjective] social classes are quite liquid and volatile, it has become evident that we need to curb that flow of Ronin and Samurai into the upper peasant and merchant class. These warriors, in order to ensure a steady flow of income and men, oftentimes became merchants in order to avoid taxation. Thus, the edict might displease the samurai lords by laying down severe punishment for all who attempt to cross their respective social class."
 ME_Japan_Events36.EVTOPT1: "Issue it."
 ME_Japan_Events36.EVTOPT2: "Allow the flow of classes."
