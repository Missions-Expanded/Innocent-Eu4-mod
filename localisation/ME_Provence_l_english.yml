 PRO_form_capet_desc: "The Capetian Dynasty is among the largest and oldest houses of Europe who ruled France. Our recent acquisition of French lands and the unification of the Capetian cadet house of Anjou has provided us with the opportunity of adopting the title of the house of Capet."

 CAP_from_father_to_son_for_france: "From Father, to Son"
 CAP_from_father_to_son_for_france_desc: "Instead of sticking to some sort of traditional distributive method of passing the right to rule on once the current ruler dies, we of the House of Capet prefer to do things from father to son and only in this regard if we can help it. It helps focus our goals and can help regulate the positions in the royal court we currently have."

 CAP_blessed_by_carolingian_prestige: "The Legacy of the Caorlingians"
 CAP_blessed_by_carolingian_prestige_desc: "The Carolingian Dynasty has a great and glorious reputation in the lands of Europe, but to succeed it is no easy task. Hugh Capet, the founder of the House of Capet, was elected to succeed Louis V in 987 and he proved that our bloodline is just as capable of succeeding where the Carloingians left off, giving us a prestigious dynastic lineage that few in Europe can match."

 CAP_rein_the_cadet_branches_in: "Rein in the Cadet Branches"
 CAP_rein_the_cadet_branches_in_desc: "With a prestigious royal house comes with it cadet branches that split off and rule nearby places, at least that is what most are used to. The House of Capet is no different and because of this we have some very autonomous cadet branches that have developed over the years. Initiating a process of reining them in and making amends for past feuds that might've erupted can make a much stronger and more centralized dynasty."

 CAP_away_with_salic_law_in_with_new_laws_desc: "The old ways of Salic Law are just simply not going to hold up as time goes on. We need to work on refining the laws of France and make sure that they stem from Capetian administrators... Or at least administrators who are acting in the interest of the House of Capet. Without these refined laws of the land, we're just left with an administrative mess entangled with royal houses across the land."

 CAP_ambitions_for_foreign_thrones: "For Foreign Thrones"
 CAP_ambitions_for_foreign_thrones_desc: "Many times our sons will have ambitions to start their ruling of land early, but when their father is still alive, this creates tension that the House of Capet simply does not need. Directing them to marry nearby noble women so that they can aim for nearby foreign thrones is a much better use for their time and money so that we can project Capetian influence further outward whilst maintaining a greater sense of internal stability."

 CAP_crusade_memories_of_capetian_france: "Memories of the Crusades"
 CAP_crusade_memories_of_capetian_france_desc: "Despite the disaster the crusades ended up being for Christendom, the House of Capet and its cadet branches thoroughly remember it and strive for the martial prowess it gave some of our most stand-out figures. Religious wars may not be at the forefront of politics anymore, but for us, it is still a viable path for war and we will take advantage of religious conflicts whenever we can."
 
 CAP_formalized_french_regality: "Nobility in our Blood"
 CAP_formalized_french_regality_desc: "Every soldier, be they descended from high ranking nobility or from mere peasants, will know the regality and nobility of the state that they fight for. The Capetians have strived for centuries to bring France into greatness and the soldiers have been there at every step of the way. We will inspire them and people of our very house will ride alongside said soldiers, giving them all the more reason to fight on."

 ME_Provence_Events.2.a: "We have dealt with a major rival."
 
 ME_Provence_Events.3.t: "Unifying the Capetians"
 ME_Provence_Events.3.d: "The Capetian dynasty is one of the largest and oldest royal houses in all of Europe and the world. Due to dynastic rivalries it got broken down into many cadet braches which spread all over Europe. With the reunification of these cadet branches many have started dreaming of a return to the Capetian Empire."
 ME_Provence_Events.3.a: "Our dynasty has finally reunited."
 
 ME_Provence_Events.4.t: "The Sicilian Dream"
 ME_Provence_Events.4.d: "At long last, our dream of controlling Sicily and returning it back into our fold is complete.

"

 ME_Provence_Events.6.t: "Restoring the Feast"
 ME_Provence_Events.6.d: "\"I will return to Jerusalem, my holy city, and live there. It will be known as the faithful city, and the hill of the Lord Almighty.  Once again old men and women, so old that they use canes when they walk, will be sitting in the city squares.  And the streets will again be full of boys and girls playing. I will rescue my people from the lands where they have been taken,  and will bring them back from east and west to live in Jerusalem.\" We have fulfilled Gods prophecy and restored Jerusalem back to its rightful owners. It will be a beacon of light to all Christians alike. The third temple will be restored and preparations will be made for the coming of the messianic age. All of Christendom will once again celebrate the liberation of Jerusalem with The Feast that our forefathers once had in remembrance of the First Liberation during the First Crusade."

 ME_Provence_Events.8.t: "A Modest Request"
 ME_Provence_Events.8.d: "The city of Avignon, which was owned by the county of Provence was given to us due to a conflict between the French crown and the holy see. The papacy has moved back Rome but we still own Avignon. Provence has currently sent us a formal letter asking from us to give Avignon back."
 ME_Provence_Events.8.a: "We should thank them for their hospitality and give Avignon back to them."
 ME_Provence_Events.8.b: "We are above such requests."
 
 ME_Provence_Events.9.t: "A \"Good\" Offer"
 ME_Provence_Events.9.d: "The incapability of Charles the Bold in producing any male offspring has us now on the edge. Our country has swayed into the hands of the treacherous "Good King" who has his eyes firmly on our hold. Diplomats have arrived into our court asking us to be integrated diplomatically into the Provencal lands for some autonomy."
 ME_Provence_Events.9.a: "Let us merge our states into a greater country."
 ME_Provence_Events.9.b: "We reject the good king's offer. Vive la Lorraine!"
 
 ME_Provence_Events.10.t: "A Letter From the Emperor"
 ME_Provence_Events.10.d: "With our acquisition of the Duchy of Lorraine we have come very close inside the sphere of influence of the Holy Roman Empire. The emperor has sent us an invitational letter that will grant us access into the empire. Being a member of the empire will surely be a decisive factor when it comes to protection but it will end up ruining our relations with France."
 ME_Provence_Events.10.a: "We must rely on the empire and forgo of all alliances."
 ME_Provence_Events.10.b: "We can't betray France and forgo of their protection."
 
 ME_Provence_Events.11.t: "La Fete"
 ME_Provence_Events.11.d: "They say that time is the wisest councilor of all. In due time all intentions become clear. With our long lasting and peaceful over lordship of France, our mutual friendship has grown stronger and firmer. Both our courts have, day by day, gotten closer and inseparable."
