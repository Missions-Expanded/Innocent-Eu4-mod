 # Missions:
 mal_revitalize_the_empire_title: "Revitalize the Empire"
 mal_revitalize_the_empire_desc: "The Mali Empire was once a grand archetype for state-building: the wealthiest in the world, riding on the backs of the brave traders of the Trans-Saharan trade network. Our decline has been steady and our heads are held low; this cannot continue. It is time to cease the continuous loss of territory and begin our Grand Restoration."
 mal_reintegrate_senegal_title: "Reintegrate Senegal"
 mal_reintegrate_senegal_desc: "Our northward neighbors control the point in which the Senegal estuary meets the river--our river. They seem to believe they have any sort of claim to the region which used to be ours. If we wish to reestablish a monetary foothold in the region, their reckoning must come sooner rather than later."
 mal_aditional_trading_posts_title: "Additional Trading Ports"
 mal_aditional_trading_posts_desc: "Europe has long since been our trading partner, though recently they seem more interested in taking our goods by force rather than pay for our valuable salt and gold. For both defensive and mercantile purposes, we should establish an outpost closer to our main buyers to make trade easier and dissuade our enemies from invasion."
 mal_iberian_threat_title: "Iberian Threat"
 mal_iberian_threat_desc: "Our recent attempts to work peacefully with the Europeans have backfired dramatically; they have only increased attempts at colonization. Though it is unlikely we can defeat their superior militaries with our armies, there is more than one way to kill an elephant."
 mal_islamic_brotherhood_title: "Islamic Brotherhood"
 mal_islamic_brotherhood_desc: "Looking to the north, we find our allies in faith in a perilous situation. The Christians employ brutish violence and wanton cruelty to supplement their strained budgets. Their flippancy in the face of a southward threat is slightly disconcerting; it seems as though they take us for fools. It is time to starve the dying elephant once and for all."
 mal_consolidate_the_bend_title: "Consolidate the Bend"
 mal_consolidate_the_bend_desc: "With the Niger Bend in sight, it is time to fully integrate this past foundation of the Mali Empire and fully realize our past identity before looking to the future."
 mal_infrigement_doctrine_title: "Infringement Doctrine"
 mal_infrigement_doctrine_desc: "To combat European aggression, we must use a combination of peace and aggression ourselves. We are in a great position to establish a settlement alongside the Castilian colony on the Canaries. Not only will this put us at an incredible position for expansion into Maghreb, it would also allow us yet another trading outpost and expand out economic influence."
 mal_trans_saharan_empire_title: "Trans-Saharan Empire"
 mal_trans_saharan_empire_desc: "By using our colonies as jumping-off points for Moroccan expansion, we can essentially skip the Saharan lands that only serve as an intermediary between our empire and theirs. Our traders will be just as happy marching across the Sahara whether we own the land or not."
 mal_the_old_borders_title: "The Old Borders"
 mal_the_old_borders_desc: "Our empire has been on a slow decline for the past few centuries. The Europeans no longer buy our goods; the Africans no longer support us. However, the situation is not hopeless. We may still emerge victorious through a few well-placed conquests."
 mal_continued_momentum_title: "Continued Momentum"
 mal_continued_momentum_desc: "Our expansionist policies seem to be working. If we continue on our current path, we can manage to expand past our original size."
 mal_the_rule_of_law_title: "The Ruler of the Law"
 mal_the_rule_of_law_desc: "Through the ages, we have learned one very important skill: administration. Our relatively humble beginnings allow us to see order where others see chaos; law when some see anarchy. We may be able to integrate native customs in nearby stateless societies into our administration, hopefully for the best."
 mal_ivory_coast_title: "The Ivory Coast"
 mal_ivory_coast_desc: "It is a simple matter to expand our borders now that we have established a firm foothold within West Africa. Our next priority should be ensuring domestic trade interests are protected from European colonialism to both starve them out and increase our prosperity."
 mal_glory_to_mali_title: "Glory to Mali"
 mal_glory_to_mali_desc: "We faced tough times yet managed to prosper due to our tenacity and adequate leadership. We are no longer in danger of collapse and have no reason to worry over Europeans invasion or African dissent. The sun has set on the northern empires, and it has risen for Mali."
 mal_the_first_city_title: "The First City"
 mal_the_first_city_desc: "Gao is a major center of Islamic learning. The Songhai maliciously use this knowledge to expand their borders and abuse their people, which is unacceptable for a brother in faith. Our new Divine Task is to challenge their control of Gao and use this knowledge for the good of all."
 mal_the_second_city_title: "The Second City"
 mal_the_second_city_desc: "Timbuktu: the point in which Islam entered West Africa. If the reconquista continues as it currently is, Timbuktu may fall victim to the crusading cretins that lie to our north. For all parties to benefit, we must take this city as our own."
 mal_western_islamic_empire_title: "Western Islamic Empire"
 mal_western_islamic_empire_desc: "Though neither the Umayyads nor the Abbasids managed to reach West Africa in their conquests, our faith allows us to continue their legacy. We can't change the past, but we are in control of our own sphere of influence."
 mal_potential_of_timbuktu_title: "Potential of Timbuktu"
 mal_potential_of_timbuktu_desc: "Timbuktu is still recovering from our siege. We need to improve the land vastly before we can truly call ourselves liberators. We could always expand the market and improve the local economy by proving some semblance of economic infrastructure..."
 mal_the_saharan_gap_title: "The Saharan Gap"
 mal_the_saharan_gap_desc: "Between the rich lands of Maghreb and Timbuktu, there lies a vast expanse of waste: sand, sand, and the occasional oasis. If we manage to establish a permanent settlement between the two regions, we may be able to expand our trade exponentially."
 mal_northward_neighbours_title: "Northward Neighbours"
 mal_northward_neighbours_desc: "In order to combat European Imperialism, we need to know our enemy fully and without the hamper of heralds and emissaries. We need to establish full relations with the European nations and finally figure out the people that are so advanced."
 mal_revitalize_islam_title: "Revitalize Islam"
 mal_revitalize_islam_desc: "Islamic influence doesn't grasp our people as much as we would hope. Traditional African religions inhabit our realm far more than the Sunnite influence we need. The legitimacy it provides is far outweighed by our lack of a cohesive religion, which needs to change."
 mal_great_minds_of_islam_title: "Great Minds of Islam"
 mal_great_minds_of_islam_desc: "West African thinkers, in our unbiased opinion, are among the best in the world. We should invite a few to our court to gain a better understanding of our administration."
 mal_pick_up_the_dregs_title: "Pick up the Dregs"
 mal_pick_up_the_dregs_desc: "The city of Timbuktu was the center of a grand nation which we have inadvertently caused great strife to. We must atone for our sins by incorporating the rest into our vast empire and protecting it from our violent eastward neighbors. "
 mal_university_of_sankore_title: "University of Sankore"
 mal_university_of_sankore_desc: "One of the three ancient centers of Islamic learning in Timbuktu, it was greatly damaged in our siege of the city. This cannot stand, or we will have become the barbarians we swore ourselves against. We can at least rebuild the structure to its former glory to show our appreciation to the people of Timbuktu and Allah for this great victory and blessing."
 mal_celestial_guidance_title: "Celestial Guidance"
 mal_celestial_guidance_desc: "Below us is the earth. Above us is the sky. When the earth turns dark, the sky does not. Above us is an endless expanse of light, one in which we have no knowledge of besides obvious recurring trends. While we will never dare to make our own attempts to reach the heavens, to satisfy our ever-growing curiosity we must learn more about what lies above."
 mal_the_footsteps_of_abu_bakr_title: "The Footsteps of Abu Bakr"
 mal_the_footsteps_of_abu_bakr_desc: "The limitless expanse of clear, liquidy ocean to our west; the vast, rolling waves of dunes to our east; the choice is clear. We must explore the limits of the seas and comply with the ninth mansa's wishes."
