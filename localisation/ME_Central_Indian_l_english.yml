 #Central Indian Missions
 cen_ind_unity_and_foundation_title: "Planting of Roots"
 cen_ind_unity_and_foundation_desc: "The politics of Central India are constantly in flux as of now. Chiefs and Rajas are making claims and fighting over various pieces of land that are hard to maintain, but who is to say this volatile region can't become prosperous and stable? That is what we must ultimately strive for as of now. It will be a struggle against those of equal size to us, but great states are not born out of mere thin air."
 cen_ind_infrastructure_and_money_title: "Burgeoning State"
 cen_ind_infrastructure_and_money_desc: "The internal foundation of our state is fairly rural and underdeveloped with only the capital seeing widespread urban growth. Still, even with this, our control remains tenuous in certain areas what with locals still seeing themselves as partially independent or autonomous. By securing a more stable political environment and actively promoting building projects to not only boost our wealth and prestige but also to help grow some of the smaller cities we control, we will garner more trust with our own people."
 cen_ind_hindu_scholars_title: "Forward Thinking"
 cen_ind_hindu_scholars_desc: "Tied down before by tribal politics and feuding clans, we have found our way past those times and toward an active and somewhat centralized administration. Now is the time to begin looking toward those who can benefit the central court most, whether they be interested in the natural sciences or in the art of military strategies."
 cen_ind_summon_chief_troops_title: "Chiefs and Officers"
 cen_ind_summon_chief_troops_desc: "Scattered are many military-oriented people in our land. Chiefs and officers alike are seemingly more bound to their villages and communities than to us of the administration, but we must work to change this and slowly but surely move to a more centralized and loyal military system that transcends tribal and clan loyalties."
 cen_ind_first_conquests_title: "Draw First Blood"
 cen_ind_first_conquests_desc: "The jungles and forests do not settle down just because political shifts in cities occur, no, they rumble loudly with the might elephants and people alike! Like our ancestors before us have tried to, let us do the same and wage war on our neighbors so that we may finally strive to unite the Gondi, Garjati, the Jharkhandi!"
 cen_ind_refined_fighting_title: "Refined Fighting"
 cen_ind_refined_fighting_desc: "The Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi are seen as primitive to the other states in the north, south, and west. They see us as tribal and unable to adapt to changing times, but we are proving them wrong as each day, week, and month goes by. The surest sign of this is our use of and slow integration of firearms into the ranks of our soldiers; with them, the battles fought by our people will no longer be so one-sided."
 cen_ind_legit_administration_title: "Rule with Authority"
 cen_ind_legit_administration_desc: "Our administration has often struggled to maintain internal unity and peace as several communities are influenced by tribal politics and clan events whilst paying little attention or service to the central authority. In order to being changing this, we need to make sure we are a stable and authoritative state, and also one that can put down insurgencies before they get a chance to make progress. Once this is done, we can begin the slow process of centralization."
 cen_ind_basic_loyalties_title: "Basic Loyalty"
 cen_ind_basic_loyalties_desc: "The administration is not just an isolated body that dictates people from afar, not in the slightest. There are several parts of our administration that are integrated within the lower castes of society and we need each and every single part of the administration to work together so that we do not fall prey to stagnation and decadence."
 cen_ind_landed_elites_title: "Landed Elites"
 cen_ind_landed_elites_desc: "The most power-hungry of the administration's sectors are the Brahmins and the Rajputs and this is well known by many. Respected as they are in our state, they are also attempting to increase their power and influence throughout the land at the expense of others. This, of course, clashes with other parts of the administration at times but we try to keep this all in check through effective and coherent land distribution to various families and dynasties. We must make sure that the Brahmins and Rajputs stay loyal through this land distrbution, lest we want them to actively hinder our efforts elsewhere."
 cen_ind_southern_area_title: "Contest for Garjat"
 cen_ind_southern_area_desc: "The area of Garjat has been home to several tribes for a long time but it was once the crossroads of several ancient, classical, and medieval Indian kingdoms and empires. Historically and culturally significant but still being very hard to tame, we must do what few have ever done and take over Garjat as a whole and lock it down."
 cen_ind_central_area_title: "Seize Upper Manhandi"
 cen_ind_central_area_desc: "The heart of where most people consider tribal in India, the Upper Mahandi area has been a tough place to invade by several powers from the past including the Delhi Sultanate. True unity can only come from within the region as a whole and we must be the one to do so before another foreign power attempts to exert power over the area."
 cen_ind_northern_area_title: "Fight for Jharkhand"
 cen_ind_northern_area_desc: "On the border with the Oriya, Bengali, and Bihari people, Jharkhand is very much a lucrative yet dangerous area. The ferocity of the northern Islamic powers is well known and their line-of-sight often has parts of Jharkhand within it, but the Jharkhandi are resilient people who have put a fight every single time the Muslims striked at them. Let us bring these fighters and traders into our fold before they are ultimately overwhelmed by others."
 cen_ind_final_places_title: "The Final Steps"
 cen_ind_final_places_desc: "The coming power of the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi people is without end as our neighbors know that we are a true power in Indian politics. We must not stop here, however; we must strive to unite all of our kin under one flag rather than being split up between various foreign powers. Once we have enough power beneath us, we will find ourselves ready to become a truly unified state that started from the ground up with a burgeoning capital to go along with it."

 desc_central_indian_founding_of_nagpur: "We are currently in the process of moving our capital toward the west, which means a temporary lapse in administrative effectivness. As a result, power has become slightly more decentralized and been given to local authorities during this time."
