 ###MISSIONS###
 bng_taluqdar_zamindar_conflict_title: "End the Land Conflict"
 bng_taluqdar_zamindar_conflict_desc: "Conflicts between the Landed Muslims and Local Hindus have spilled over into the local Nobility, causing trouble in both court and land. The Zamindars claim divine guidance, as Allah would have wished, while the Taluqdars claim ancestral rights, which has been denied for years since the Ghurid and Delhian invasions. The Sultan choose his favourite, but it is possible to unite them both, either forcefully or with coercion." 
 bng_afghan_nobility_title: "Rights of the Afghans"
 bng_afghan_nobility_desc: "Like our forefathers, Delhi, we too have a sizable community of Afghan Nobles who have considerable political control over the country. But the constant threat of invasion and turmoil in the east have driven more and more towards Jaunpur, Bengal and other Sultanates who welcome them. Their influence grows, but many were warlords, who can easily help us in military reform."
 bng_procure_bombards_title: "Procuring Bombards"
 bng_procure_bombards_desc: "Bengal's supremacy can be attributed to their efficiency in the acquisition of artillery. Ban, Hawai and other rockets have been traveling on an easterly trajectory, and has now reached Bengal, where aspiring generals are looking for glory. Our continued cooperation with the Brokers must continue, lest we fall behind."
 bng_empower_paiks_title: "Readying the Paiks"
 bng_empower_paiks_desc: "The palace guards are numerous and strong. But their loyalty is questionable. Staffed by the Habshis, their proximity to the Sultan is worrying due to the affluence of the Harem, as times have proven that the Abyssinians are nothing but loyal to coin. It is better to staff them with more loyal, Muslim and local men, who are trained by the crown to serve the crown, and nothing else."
 bng_integrate_peasant_bands_title: "Integration of the Baksariyas"
 bng_integrate_peasant_bands_desc: "The Region of the Ganges is home to Massive populations of peasants that often find themselves out of work after war, due to their forced contributions by their Zamindars. They have formed peasant war bands in search of naukri, and have taken up moneylending as well, often at Bengali villages. This form of tribalism is proving disastrous, as anyone with enough mony could simply overrun the Sultanate, so it would be better to integrate these peasants into the army instead."
 bng_legacy_of_pala_title: "Legacy of the Palas"
 bng_legacy_of_pala_desc: "An empire that founded Bengal's administrative machinery, the Pala empire defined Bengali pluralism and central authority. Their heathen descent matters little to any Shah-i-Bangalah, who pride themselves on acceptance. Much of the Dhimmi look to the past empires as a bastion against the word of Allah, yet if we want to style ourselves as Bengali Rajas, and prevent another Raja Ganesha, religion must not divide Bangalah."
 bng_expand_mint_towns_title: "Expansion of Mint Towns"
 bng_expand_mint_towns_desc: "Bengal is home to the Taka, which has become the standard currency of trade for years, which has resulted in a greater demand for the coin. The area of the delta currently has 27 mint towns, with the most prominent being Mahmudabad, Khalifatabad, Satgaon and Firuzabad. These can easily be expanded to greater heights, supervised by our treasury, for the service of Indian Trade."
 bng_search_for_silver_title: "In Search of Silver"
 bng_search_for_silver_desc: "A growing empire needs a stable currency, one that can be minted and traded. While production continues to increase, resources become scarcer. Luckily, Burma lies close, where traders exchange Gold and Silver as a form of transaction. The city of Pegu houses many Bengali merchants who take part in local trade. Taking this city may provide us with the monopoly to ramp up Silver Production, and expand our trading links."
 bng_persian_immigrants_title: "Persian Immigration"
 bng_persian_immigrants_desc: "The form of government we proudly wear comes from Persia and the Persian world, like many Sultanates. This is seen through both Sassanian and Timurid imperial paradigm in court, as well as the lingua franca being Persian, making it easier to incorporate capable administrators into the harem. However, many other communities have seen this acceptance of easterly ways, and have begun immigrating into Bengal. Afghans, Pashtuns and Armenians. Most notably, after their expulsion, 40,000 Armenians have settled in Dhaka, adding to its already glamorous prestige, and are eagerly cashing in on the affluency local trade."
 bng_facilitate_trade_title: "Facilitating Trade Connections"
 bng_facilitate_trade_desc: "Bengali Merchants are seen all over the Indian Ocean, from the depths of Arabia, to the Porch of Mecca, The busy shipping routes between Basra and Malacca, and the islands of the Maldives. This is all thanks to heavy settlement in the city by both Bengalis and Persians. The port is also located in a natural harbour, and its links to Bengali sericulture make it a rich entrepot. These connections are wary, but true to Ma Huan's testimony, the flourishing seafaring industries can only grow."
 bng_cowry_shells_title: "Cowry Shell Trading"
 bng_cowry_shells_desc: "Bengal and the Maldives have enjoyed a beneficial relationship for decades, with shiploads of Cowry Shells being imported, subsidising the islands in return for currency. All large business transactions are done in terms of silver taka, while smaller purchases involve shell currency. However, with the arrival of the Europeans, the islands may possibly come under threat. We must make sure that the islands continue to stay under Bengali influence, even if they were to come into another country's hands. We rely on shiploads of cowry shell imports from the Maldives, so it would be beneficial to monopolise this important commodity, but it would cause no harm to maintain informal control."
 bng_maritime_silk_road_title: "Maritime Silk Road"
 bng_maritime_silk_road_desc: "Overland trade routes are frail, and subject to disaster, such as the plague, and the Mongol conquests. The shift to maritime trade has been inevitable, and sitting at the crossroads between the Arab world and China presents an opportunity. Instability in the Coromandel, and the arrival of the Ostend, East-Indian and French companies prove that trade will flow past Bengal, its now up to us to keep a clasp on the foreign traders."
 bng_inferno_title: "An Inferno Full of Gifts"
 bng_inferno_desc: "Despite Bengal's hot and tropical climate, trade has flourished to the extent that the Bay of Bengal is now the world's busiest and richest hub of trade. The Khorasanis once referred to the region as "An Inferno Full of Gifts", a description that is becoming more replaced by "Paradise of Nations". One thing for certain is that there is nothing like it."
 bng_mir_bahar_title: "Oversight by the Mir Bahar"
 bng_mir_bahar_desc: "Much of the Delta is easily accessible by ship, and requires constant policing. One benefit is that the riverine geography of the land has become accustomed to by Bengals seamen. who know the snaking distributaries better than no-one. Combined with a centralised authority who's job it is to build boats of all kinds for river transport, fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants, recruit efficient seamen and supervise the rivers, the Delta is as secure as ever."
 bng_royal_port_title: "Commission the Royal Port"
 bng_royal_port_desc: "Satgaon used to be the most important port of Bengal. The merchants of Satgaon did not have to leave their town and could earn fortune just staying home as the outside world came to them for trade. As the chief mart of Bengal, Satgaon attracted merchants from different parts of India and other countries. However, Satgaon is beginning to decline mainly due to the silting of the river Saraswati, which makes navigation extremely difficult. Already a centre of inland trade, Hughli is overtaking Satgaon, and has the benefit of being coastal and adjacent. With flourishing foreign trade being set up by the Portuguese, it will take little more than a royal decree to institute mercantile reform in the province."
 bng_great_traditions_title: "The Great Traditions"
 bng_great_traditions_desc: "Bengal is split into 2 main "traditions" - Hinduism and Islam. These traditions are remarkable in their own ways, despite the inherent rivalry shared between them, and cooperation is seen on the level of Al-Andalus. This harmony can easily be extended to encompass a wide variety of religions, with humanist philosophy becoming core to the Bengali identity"
 bng_develop_poetry_title: "Developing Poetry Traditions"
 bng_develop_poetry_desc: "And with the three washers, this dispute is going on.\nAll the parrots of India have fallen into a sugar shattering situation\nThat this Persian candy, to Bangalah is going on.'\n\nMuslim poets were writing in the Bengali language by the 15th century. By the turn of the 16th century, a vernacular literature based on concepts of Sufism and Islamic cosmology flourished in the region. Bengali Muslim mystic literature was one of the most original in Islamic India. Dobhashi is a neologism used to refer to a customary form of writing in Bengali. The majority of poetry written by Bengali poets are written in this style, mixing Bengali and Sanskrit/Persian structure, resulting in a versatile vernacular. Each poem can be read by both Persians and Bengalis, and mimics Arabic writing styles."
 bng_mosque_style_title: "Bengali Style"
 bng_mosque_style_desc: "The mosques of Bengal have several common features, including pointed arches, multiple mihrabs, engaged corner towers, and terracotta and stone decoration. In particular, the art of the mihrab is meticulous and unique to Bengal's mosque architecture. Mosques are either rectangular and multi-domed or square and single-domed. These mosques dotted the countryside, ranged from small to medium sizes and were used for daily devotion. Ponds were often located beside a mosque. Arabic inscriptions in the mosques often include the name of the patron or builder. The most commonly cited verse from the Quran in inscriptions was Surah 72 (Al-Jinn). The buildings were made of brick or stone. The brick mosque with terracotta decoration represented a grand structure in the Bengal Sultanate. They were often the gift of a wealthy patron and the fruit of extraordinary effort, which would not be found in every Muslim neighborhood."
 bng_sycnretic_missionaries_title: "Syncretic Missionaries"
 bng_sycnretic_missionaries_desc: "The Sufis of the delta aren't aggressive nor useless. They spend much of their time helping local communities and contemplating mystic thought. Many Hindus have become so enamoured by their devotion that they have begun to convert of their own whim."
 bng_bagerhat_title: "Bagerhat Mosques"
 bng_bagerhat_desc: "Nowhere is there a higher concentration of mosques than Bagerhat, the city of mosques. Many domed, sprawling mosques dotted with madrasahs and centres of faith have been built by the Governor of the area, supported by the city of Khalifatabad. Renowned across the Islamic world, many mosques surpass all preconceived notions of what a standard mosque should be, some with arches, some with domes larger than the sun, some with more domes than rice in a paddy."
 bng_madrasas_title: "Arabian Madrasas"
 bng_madrasas_desc: "The heart of Islam has always been ripe with intellectual thought, such as the madrasas of Baghdad and Cordoba. The fall of the aforementioned cities have left a gap in Muslim innovation, causing the Europeans to finally surpass the Islamic world. Institutes such as the Ghiyasia Madrasa were sponsored by previous Bengali Sultans as a show of both piety and wealth. Continuing this patronage must surely endear Bengal to the rest of the Sunni world"
 bng_islamic_cooperation_title: "Islamic Cooperation"
 bng_islamic_cooperation_desc: "From the days of the Ummayids, and even the founding of the Rashiduns, Islam remains fractured. While not as extreme and barbaric as the Heathen christians squabble about, many states diverge further and further in petty disagreement on how the word of Allah shall be told. Religious Tolerance, here, is extended to those who don't even follow the Abrahamic religions yet in Islam, any differing words are silenced. If Islam is to stand the test of time, one Sultanate must unite the bickering Madhabs."
 bng_cities_title: "Cities of the Delta"
 bng_cities_desc: "The region of the delta is predominantly agrarian, but our large population allows us to support a flourishing community of artisans and merchants in the urban districts that dot the coast and river banks. Sonargaon, Hughli, Chittagong, Gaur, Dhaka, and Khalifatabad all have promise, with Minting, Weaving and Mulberry plantations in place already."
 bng_gaur_affluency_title: "Affluency of Gaur"
 bng_gaur_affluency_desc: "Gauda is one one the largest and most affluent cities in India. The city has a citadel, a royal palace and durbar, many mosques, residences for aristocrats and merchants, and bazaars. European travellers left detailed and extensive accounts of Gaur, with the Portuguese comparing the affluence of the city with Lisbon. The royal palace is divided into three compartments. A high wall encloses the palace with a moat surrounding it on three sides, connected to the Ganges, guarding the western side of the citadel. The first compartment in the north includes the durbar. An inscription of Sultan Ruknuddin Barbak Shah mentions a fountain and water channel located halfway from the Dakhil Darwaza gate. The gate still stands today. According to the Portuguese and medieval Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha, the road from the Dakhil Darwaza to the durbar has nine well-guarded gates. The second compartment was the living quarter of the Sultan which is adorned with glazed tiles of various colours."
 bng_bengali_renaissance_title: "Bengal Renaissance"
 bng_bengali_renaissance_desc: "There is nothing wrong with the blending of cultures. Some even refer to the Bhati as "The Melting Pot of India", yet there are worries about Bengali as a language and culture being lost to time. Many reformist movements have become questioning the orthodoxy of some traditions, as well as the revitalisation of Bengali. These people often come under the movement "Brahmo Sabha", which utilises religion as a way of persuading those who have aversion to change."
 bng_lifeblood_title: "Lifeblood of Bengal"
 bng_lifeblood_desc: "The Ganges-Brahmaputra confluence is the lifeblood of Bengal. Much of the population, farms and cities lie on the ever shifting distributaries that snake across the Delta and Sundarbans. It is here that economic development can be stimulated, forests cleared and trade promoted."
 bng_rice_title: "Baskets of Rice"
 bng_rice_desc: "Bengal produces many items like rice, cotton, millet, pulses, lentils, sugarcane, sesame, ghee, butter, honey, garlic, ginger, the oil of zeuzerine, mustard, long pepper and betel-nuts. But the dramatic increase in population has been fuelled by rice and more rice. The fertility of Bhati combined with the growth of farmlands is one of the countless reasons of the productivity we see today. New irrigation technologies such as the Na'ura allow the sowing and reaping of crops 3 times per year."
 bng_ganga_rashtra_title: "Ganga Rashtra"
 bng_ganga_rashtra_desc: "'Nation on the Ganges', the name which we had been referred to by Alexander has stuck and is becoming increasingly synonymous with Bengal. The Ganges region is the most fertile in the world, and our water and crops are all fed from the flowing waters, tributaries and distributaries. But, times are changing, and agrarianism is becoming increasingly replaced by urban populations elsewhere. Yet, Bengal remains unique. A high population means that the increasing urban sprawls still require being fed, but can be done by blending both manufacturing societies and farming communities. A harmony between the rural peasant and the urban weaver is necessary to remain strong; A River with a State."
 bng_jamdani_title: "Jamdani Dhakai"
 bng_jamdani_desc: "Whether figured or flowered, jamdani is a woven fabric in cotton. This is a supplementary weft technique of weaving, where the artistic motifs are produced by a non-structural weft, in addition to the standard weft that holds the warp threads together. The standard weft creates a fine, sheer fabric while the supplementary weft with thicker threads adds the intricate patterns to it. Each supplementary weft motif is added separately by hand by interlacing the weft threads into the warp with fine bamboo sticks using individual spools of thread. The result is a complex mix of different patterns that appear to float on a shimmering surface. The pattern is not sketched or outlined on the fabric, but is drawn on a graph paper and placed underneath the warp. Jamdani is a fine muslin cloth on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white. Often a mixture of cotton and gold thread was used."
 bng_gangajal_title: "Gangajal"
 bng_gangajal_desc: "The "Holy Water" feeds both people and industry, but it's not always enough. While the agrarian sector has made leaps and bounds in terms of its technology, weaving is stuck in the past. Lauh-pāy or loom-pedal is a board like device used to open and close the shed by movement of the feet; allowing the weavers to keep their hands free to handle the shuttle, increasing production tenfold. The worm gear-driven Indian roller-gin, if employed at the same time, can further improve production. Water wheels can also be constructed, allowing for easier milling of grain and spinning of looms. The Ganges is a gift from god!"
 bng_house_of_ganesh_title: "The House of Ganesh"
 bng_house_of_ganesh_desc: "After the end of Ganesh rule, and the following reconstruction, the house still remains as strong as ever. But with deteriorated relations, Hindu and Muslim nobles seldom co-operate with each other. We must repair the relationship between Zamindar and Taluqdar, as the fruits of their relationship would benefit Bengal"
 bng_issue_land_title: "Issuing Land Grants"
 bng_issue_land_desc: "Land is distributed through 3 methods. Iqta land is given as a subsidiary instead of outright payment for officials, as thanks for their services. Khalisa land is the Sultan's own, and the revenue generated is used to fund the royal household. Finally, Inam land is for religious officials to appease the clergy. In order to prevent disaster once again, we must find a balance between patronage and preventing puppet status."
 bng_rajput_relations_title: "Relations with the Rajputs"
 bng_rajput_relations_desc: "The Rajputs of Northern India are simultaneously diverse and equally difficult to reign in. Either envy or pride drives them, but they are as different from their horseback cousins in Rajputana as a mangoe is from a grain of rice. However, the advent of gunpowder has encouraged them to be more pro-active militarily. Most often they are from Bihar and Purvanchal, yet they are seen as far as Ahmedabad, Bidar and Dhaka. Our relationship has the possibility to blossom into a very mutually beneficial one, standardising the large pool of Purbiya mercenaries into a formidable royal guard or even a standing army."
 bng_prepare_for_war_title: "Prepare against Shiraz-i-Hind"
 bng_prepare_for_war_desc: "While Bengal got off pretty well in 1415, it gave us a fair warning that our regional hegemony can easily be challenged. Unfortunately, Bengal is not known for its military, bar the use of slave soldiers, and thus we are seen as easy picking. This is more than enough justification for preperations, even if the cost is high. Jaunpur must not be the death of Bengal!"
 bng_bihar_title: "Seizing Bihar"
 bng_bihar_desc: "Bihar is home to the Ujjainiya tribe of Rajputs, who had recently been figthing against Jaunpur in a guerilla style campaign. The head of the resistance, Raja Harra, is long dead, but the tribes here are of great use to us. They serve as the perfect excuse to invade, under guise of protection."

 ###EVENTS###
 
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.t: "The Armenians of Armanitola"
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.d: "The Armenian community of Dhaka were initially engaged in export trade paying a duty of 3.5% to the government. They lived in the neighborhoods of Moulbivazar and Nolgola, before moving to Armanitola. They have also sponsored and patronised the growth of education, establishing the Pogose School for less wealthy students.\n\nThe Armenians have quickly been expanding their prospects, controlling up to a quarter of the local textile trade, and monopolising the production of Jutes. While this is spur in production has done wonders for the traders of Dhaka, some are worried that their monopolistic attitude may harm the Bengali economy in the long run."
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.opt1: "The Ganges accepts everyone"
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.opt2: "We must protect the locals!"

 ME_Bengal_Events.2.t: "Standard Currency of Trade"
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.d: "Shipments of cowry shells fuel our economy, but they mainly come from the Maldives. Cowry shells act as a standard form of currency, replacing gold due to its rarity, and cowry's abundance. While large business transactions are done using the silver taka, smaller ones rely on these shells, so it is important to secure this trade."
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.opt1: "The islands are fine on their own, as long as they give us what we want"
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.opt2: "Allow local autonomy, but exercise limited control"
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.opt3: "Ensure crown control over the islands"

 ME_Bengal_Events.3.t: "Jamdani Dhakai"
 ME_Bengal_Events.3.d: "'The City of Dhaka is a very large, spacious one, but stands on low, marshy, swampy ground, and the water of that ground is very brackish, which is the only inconvenience. It has, however, some very fine conveniences that compensate, having a very fine and large river that runs close by the city walls, navigable by ships of 500 or 600 tonnes burden. The water of the river, being an arm of the Ganges, is extraordinarily good, but is some distance for fetching and carrying for some residents of the city, the city being not less than 40 English miles in circumference. It is an admirable city for its greatness, for its magnificent buildings, and the multitude of its inhabitants. A very great and potent, permanent, and paid army is based here, in a constant state of readiness. Also, many large, strong, and stately elephants, trained for battle, which are kept close to the palace.'\n\n Dhaka is home to a large community of cloth weavers who have over time become extremely skilled in their craft. around 80,000 of the city is employed in the industry, producing mainly muslin and Jamdani, a unique weave that has become synonoymous with Dhakan cloth."
 ME_Bengal_Events.3.opt1: "Weave, Ho!"

 ME_Bengal_Events.4.t: "Mosque and Tomb Architecture of Bengal"
 ME_Bengal_Events.4.d: "The mosques of Bengal have several common features, including pointed arches, multiple mihrabs, engaged corner towers, and terracotta and stone decoration. In particular, the art of the mihrab is meticulous and unique. Mosques are either rectangular and multi-domed or square and single-domed. These mosques dot the countryside, ranging from small to medium sizes and are used for daily devotion. Ponds are often located beside a mosque. Arabic inscriptions in the mosques often include the name of the patron or builder.\nMausoleums in Bengal  are important architectural hallmarks. Initially, sarcophagi were erected based on Iranian models, such as the Tomb of Cyrus. Sarcophagi would include mihrabs and arches resembling the architecture in Adina Mosque. An indigenous Islamic mausolea style developed with the Eklakhi Mausoleum, which is the royal tomb chamber of Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah. Other mausolea, such as the Tomb of Fateh Khan in Gauda, feature a Bengal roof."
 ME_Bengal_Events.4.opt1: "Ok"

 ME_Bengal_Events.5.t: "The 60 Dome Mosque"
 ME_Bengal_Events.5.d: "The Sixty Dome Mosque is a part of the Mosque City of Bagerhat and was built by Khan Jahan. Khan Jahan adorned Khalifatabad and Bagerhat with more than a dozen mosques, each having a style unique to Khan Jahan. A local madrasah was built in the city  to support the various scholars who came to study the unique architecture of the city.\n\nThe Sixty Dome Mosque has walls of unusually thick, tapered brick in the Tughlaq style and a hut-shaped roofline. There are 77 low domes arranged in seven rows of eleven, and one dome on each corner, bringing the total to 81 domes. There are four towers. Two of four towers are used to call the azaan. The interior is divided into many aisles and bays by slender columns, which culminate in numerous arches that support the roof."

 ME_Bengal_Events.6.t: "The 9 Dome Mosque"
 ME_Bengal_Events.6.d: "The Nine Dome Mosque is located to the west of the takur dighi tank and and it was built during the governorship of Khan Jahan Ali. Its western wall conventionally faces west towards Mecca, where the mihrab is inset on the western wall; terra cotta floral scrolls and flower motifs are the decorations seen around the mihrab. Circular towers are provided in the four corners. The walls of the mosque support a large central dome which has eight smaller domes around it."

 ME_Bengal_Events.7.t: "The Singhar Mosque"
 ME_Bengal_Events.7.d: "The mosque has a single hemispherical dome, in which is entirely  constructed of brick. There are three doorways in the east, and one each in the north and south. The central doorway in the east is higher and wider than the others. The exterior of the west wall has a mihrab projection from the ground to the cornice. At the four corners of the building are engaged circular towers which rise to roof level. The cornice is gently curved, being 12 inches higher at the centre than at the ends. The doorways are pointed archways set within rectangular recesses, at the top of which are several horizontal rows of terracotta ornamentation. The corner towers are divided horizontally at regular intervals by raised bands. The cornice has two bands decorated with terracotta."

 ME_Bengal_Events.8.t: "The Ronvijoypur Mosque"
 ME_Bengal_Events.8.d: "The Ronvijoypur Mosque has the largest dome in all of Bengal. It is 11 meters wide, supported by arches and pendentives. The corners have tapering circular turrets while the external cornice has a slight curve. The mosque's interior is plain, however, the main mihrabs have decorations of floral patterns."

 ME_Bengal_Events.9.t: "The Chuna Khola Mosque
 ME_Bengal_Events.9.d: "The Chuna Khola Mosque is located in the midst of rice fields in the village of Chuna Khola. It has three entrances on the east and one each on the northern and southern sides also. It has three mihrabs with the central mihrab being the largest in size and projecting outwards. It has a hemispherical dome with frontal arches. There are also squinches and half domes. It is distinctly different from the Khan Jahan style mosque in its exterior decorations, particularly the east façade, which depicts four rectangular panels bordered by foliated scrolls with merlons having plant motifs. It has four turrets with curved cornices."

 ME_Bengal_Events.10.t: "The Tomb of Khan Jahan"
 ME_Bengal_Events.10.d: "With the Death of the Saint-General, a Tomb shall be created for him. The Khan Jahan Mausoleum is located on the northern bank of a thakur dighi. The pond is square in shape and the excavated material from the tank was used to make an embankment over which the Mausoleum has been built. The pond is approached through a flight of broad and steep steps built from the embankment. The building is made of brick walls over five layers of dressed stone which forms the basement."

 ME_Bengal_Events.11.t: "Chaitanya Charitamrita"
 ME_Bengal_Events.11.d: "Krishnadasa Kaviraja wrote the primary biographies of the Hindu saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, telling his story in three parts: Adi-lila, Madhya-lila and Antya-lila.\n\nMany prominent Vaishnavas specifically requested this piece, as many had not met the man. Krishnadasa may be old, but he still worked on his magnum opus.\n\n'I have now become too old and disturbed by invalidity. While writing, my hands tremble. I cannot remember anything, nor can I see or hear properly. Still I write, and this is a great wonder.'"
 ME_Bengal_Events.11.opt1: "All glory unto my spiritual master who is as good as Chintamani"

 ME_Bengal_Events.12.t: "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu"
 ME_Bengal_Events.12.d: "Chaitanya was born in Nabadwip (in present-day West Bengal) on the full moon night of 18 February 1486, at the time of a lunar eclipse.\n\nA number of stories also exist telling of Chaitanya's apparent attraction to the chanting and singing of Krishna's names from a very young age, but largely this was perceived as being secondary to his interest in acquiring knowledge and studying Sanskrit. When travelling to Gaya to perform the Śrāddha ceremony for his departed father, Chaitanya met his guru, the ascetic Ishvara Puri, from whom he received initiation with the Gopala Krishna mantra. This meeting was to mark a significant change in Chaitanya's outlook and upon his return to Bengal the local Vaishnavas, headed by Advaita Acharya, were stunned at his external sudden 'change of heart' (from 'scholar' to 'devotee') and soon Chaitanya became the eminent leader of their Vaishnava group within Nadia.\n\nAfter leaving Bengal and receiving entrance into the sannyasa order by Swami Kesava Bharati, Chaitanya journeyed throughout the length and breadth of India for several years, chanting the divine names of Krishna constantly. At that time He travelled on foot covering a lot of places like Baranagar, Mahinagar, Atisara and, at last, Chhatrabhog. Chhatrabhog is the place where Goddess Ganga and Shiva met, then one hundred mouths of Ganga were visible from here. From the source of Vrindavana Dasa's Chaitanya Bhagavata, he bathed at Ambulinga Ghat of Chhatrabhog with intimate companions with great chorus-chanting (kirtan). After staying one night he set for Puri by boat with the help of Local Administrator Ram Chandra Khan. He spent the last 24 years of his life in Puri, Odisha, the great temple city of Jagannath in the Radhakanta Math. The Gajapati king, Prataprudra Dev, regarded Chaitanya as Krishna's avatar and was an enthusiastic patron and devotee of Chaitanya's recitation (sankeertan) gatherings. It was during these years that Chaitanya is believed by his followers to have sunk deep into various Divine-Love (samādhi) and performed pastimes of divine ecstasy (bhakti)."

 ME_Bengal_Events.13.t: "Pandabbijay"
 ME_Bengal_Events.13.d: "The Pandabbijay is a translation of the Mahabharata, an epic. Kabindra Parameshvar also appears to have eulogised the Sultan, an act that most deserves patronage."

 ME_Bengal_Events.14.t: "Nabibangsha"
 ME_Bengal_Events.14.d: "Syed Sultan is a medieval Bengali Muslim writer and epic poet. His rise to fame can be attributed to the Nabibangsha, an epic about the lineage of Mohammed, and Rasulcharita, a translation of Isra and Mi'raj."
 ME_Bengal_Events.14.opt1: "How interesting is that!"

 ME_Bengal_Events.15.t: "The Aging Krittibas Ojha"
 ME_Bengal_Events.15.d: "'Dilipa ruled like Indra, the king of the gods, but was sad as he did not have a son. Leaving behind his two wives in the city of Ayodhya, Dilipa went in search of the Ganga. He performed a severe penance for countless years, living on water and fasting, but he neither found the Ganga nor became free of his sorrow. King Dilipa died and went to Brahma's world. On his death the city of Ayodhya was kingless. In heaven, Brahma and Indra were worried: 'We have heard that Vishnu will be born in the family of the sun. How will this be possible if the line comes to an end?'\n\nKrittivas Ramayan was written by Krittibas Ojha, a great Bengali poet. The poem was composed a few years ago, but has recently exploded in popularity, and circulating these books shall provide a great boost to our legitimacy"

 ME_Bengal_Events.16.t: "Padmavati"
 ME_Bengal_Events.16.d: "Alaol has recently written the Padmavati, an epic about a Sinhala princess and Ratnasima, A Mewari king. It tells the tale about how Alauddin Khalji tries to woo the titular princess Padmavati, but focuses on the idea of secularism and love. While the poem may be a translation of Padmaavat, it still has become popular for many Bengalis."
 ME_Bengal_Events.16.opt1: "A must have!" 

 ME_Bengal_Events.17.t: "Sri Krishna-Vijaya"
 ME_Bengal_Events.17.d: "Sri Krishna-Vijaya is a book of poems considered to be the first poetry book written in Bengal. Every Bengali could read the book, as it was written in plain language. While the language used is simple, and often not sweet to hear, the book is so inexplicably popular that most Bengalis own the book themselves."
