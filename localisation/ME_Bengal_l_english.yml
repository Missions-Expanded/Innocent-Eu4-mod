The standard weft creates a fine, sheer fabric while the supplementary weft with thicker threads adds the intricate patterns to it. Each supplementary weft motif is added separately by hand by interlacing the weft threads into the warp with fine bamboo sticks using individual spools of thread. The result is a complex mix of different patterns that appear to float on a shimmering surface. The pattern is not sketched or outlined on the fabric, but is drawn on a graph paper and placed underneath the warp. Jamdani is a fine muslin cloth on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white. Often a mixture of cotton and gold thread was used."

He created teachings and became a devotee, for his life was devoted to establishing Gaudi Vaishnavism. To our muslim rule, his teachings are seen as tolerable at best, and blasphemy by the more extreme sects of our society. However, he is deemed a saint by the majority of our population, who happen to be hindus.\n\nChaitanya has begun influencing our cabinet, causing many of our administrators to follow his teachings, and his influence may endear us to the local populace, but a growing and resurgence in hindu power may hinder us in the long run."

 bng_events.38.d: "'Dilipa ruled like Indra, the king of the gods, but was sad as he did not have a son. Leaving behind his two wives in the city of Ayodhya, Dilipa went in search of the Ganga. He performed a severe penance for countless years, living on water and fasting, but he neither found the Ganga nor became free of his sorrow. King Dilipa died and went to Brahma's world. On his death the city of Ayodhya was kingless. In heaven, Brahma and Indra were worried: 'We have heard that Vishnu will be born in the family of the sun. How will this be possible if the line comes to an end?'\n\n Krittivas Ramayan was written by Krittibas Ojha, a great Bengali poet. The poem was composed a few years ago, but has recently exploded in popularity, and circulating these books shall provide a great boost to our legitimacy"
 bng_events.38.opt1: "A tradition that shall continue for centuries."

 bng_events.39.t: "Padmavati"
 bng_events.39.d: "Alaol has recently written the Padmavati, an epic about a Sinhala princess and Ratnasima, A Mewari king. It tells the tale about how Alauddin Khalji tries to woo the titular princess Padmavati, but focuses on the idea of secularism and love. While the poem may be a translation of Padmaavat, it still has become popular for many Bengalis."
 bng_events.39.opt1: "Oh the blessings of secular love."

 bng_events.40.t: "Sri Krishna Vijaya"
 bng_events.40.d: "Sri Krishna-vijaya is a book of poems considered to be the first poetry book written in Bengal. Every Bengali could read the book, as it was written in plain language. While the language used is simple, and often not sweet to hear, the book is so inxeplicably popular that most Bengalis own the book themselves."
 bng_events.40.opt1: "Everyone deserves to read this"

 bng_events.41.t: "Guru Nanak's Visit"
 bng_events.41.d: "Guru Nanak visited Bengal in the early 1500's, and had a profound influence on some of the local Hindus. This has inspired them to build a gurdwara to commemorate his visit"

 ### HABSHI DISASTER ###

 bng_habshi_coup_disaster: "Habshi Coup"

 bng_habshi_events.1.t: "The Habshis of Bengal"
 bng_habshi_events.1.d: "Habshis are notorious warriors and mercenaries, originating in East Africa. Throughout the years, they have proven useful in wars and providing useful political leverage for the Sultan, and many Indian states. There has been worry recently, as the increasing fragility of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty has also increased the power of the Habshis, with some fearing coup attempts and land seizure. While many dismiss this as simple fearmongering, it would be wise to stay weary of their growing power."
 bng_habshi_events.1.opt1: "Coups?! Nonsense! They are allied to nothing but money, which we have lots of."

 bng_habshi_events.2.t: "Habshis request Noble titles"
 bng_habshi_events.2.d: "The arrival of the Habshis have irritated some of our nobles, who argue that the intoduction of foreigners into our lands may upend the local establishment, causing a bit of a ruckus. We could try accomodating the Habshis, providing us with some monetary benefits and ridding us of the worst nobles, but this may upset the whole of the nobility"
 bng_habshi_events.2.opt1: "Grant them the titles"
 bng_habshi_events.2.opt2: "Refuse them the titles"
 
 bng_habshi_events.3.t: "Habshis Propose Clerical Seizures"
 bng_habshi_events.3.d: "Many of the Habshis that we have hired come from East Africa, with many also being hardline muslims, preaching conservative and pious sects that are less than accepted in Bengal. They have proposed seizing some of our priest's lands, as a way of enforcing Islams word in Bengal, which may upset some of our mystics."
 bng_habshi_events.3.opt1: "By all means, anything for Bengal"
 bng_habshi_events.3.opt2: "The Church shall remain entrusted with their land"
 bng_habshi_events.3.opt3: "Perhaps we can grant some titles to the Rajputs instead?"

 bng_habshi_events.4.t: "Promising Habshi Advisor"
 bng_habshi_events.4.d: "It's not just men that are being bought. Some of the slave soldiers have seen countless conflicts, requiring them to adapt towards many circumstances. One such man has made an offer to become a military advisor for our mercenaries. This may seem sketchy, especially for our aristocrats who have traditionally led the army, but this may benefit us no matter what the nobility says."
 bng_habshi_events.4.opt1: "We could use some more bright minds"
 bng_habshi_events.4.opt2: "A Foreigner? in MY court!?"

 bng_habshi_events.5.t: "Habshis request military patronage"
 bng_habshi_events.5.d: "A prestigious nation can easily make a few sacrifices when needed. That is why a man has approached us. He was purchased as a soldier, but has suggested that we fund some military programs for improving our combat ability. He appears sketchy, and many are advising against it, but he has a certain charm..."
 bng_habshi_events.5.opt1: "Sure, why not. You've got to break a few eggs"
 bng_habshi_events.5.opt2: "Turn him away; what a laughable suggestion"

 bng_habshi_events.6.t: "A Habshi High Command?"
 bng_habshi_events.6.d: "The large amount of control our nobility has on the army worries the sultan. While he feels that the Paiks are well trained, he also feels as if they are loyal more to coin than word, and is on edge as tensions have beem growing. There is a possibility of dividing power to strengthen the Sultanate, by allowing some of the Habshis to form a high command, and advise us on our war plans, weakening the nobles, but strengthening the abyssinians"
 bng_habshi_events.6.opt1: "Allow the Habshi High command"
 bng_habshi_events.6.opt2: "No man of non-noble blood sets foot near our generalty"

 bng_habshi_events.7.t: "Habshis demand religious conversion"
 bng_habshi_events.7.d: "Many habshis come from more conservative areas of islam, meaning that anything heretical or heathen is deemed worth killing over. Some soldiers dislike the religious freedom granted to many Hindus, and seek to convert them, either diplomatically or violently. Should we give in?"
 bng_habshi_events.7.opt1: "The infidels must be purged!"
 bng_habshi_events.7.opt2: "The hindus are our friends, so be careful what you say...""

 bng_habshi_events.8.t: "Word of Coups..."
 bng_habshi_events.8.d: "The growing power of the Habshis cannot be ignored any more. They are in our cabinet, our army and even staff the palace guards. Many nobles have informed us of a possible coup, which is not without merit. A choice may arrise, whether the Habshis prove to be the best for bengal, or if they must be expelled"
 bng_habshi_events.8.opt1: "We must be vigilant for the future" 

 bng_habshi_events.9.t: "Habshi Coup!"
 bng_habshi_events.9.d: "The Habshis have assasinated our Sultan!. The palace guards stormed the Sultans quarters, and have murdered him in cold blood!. This is unacceptable, and we must decide on how we must approach this!"
 bng_habshi_events.9.opt1: "The Habshis know the way for Bengal"
 bng_habshi_events.9.opt2: "Preposterous, organise a Counter-coup!"

 bng_habshi_events.10.t: "The plot disintegrates!"
 bng_habshi_events.10.d: "The low influence of the Habshis meant that our spymasters could easily root out the troublemakers, showing Bengal what we have been paying for. There is now no threat to the throne!"
 bng_habshi_events.10.opt1: "The future looks bright for Bengal" 

 bng_habshi_events.11.t: "The Dust Settles!"
 bng_habshi_events.11.d: "The rebels have been defeated, and the throne of Bengal is secure once more. We are now able to lead the Sultanate to its true destiny!"
 bng_habshi_events.11.opt1: "Let the Golden Age begin!"
 bng_habshi_events.11.opt2: "We have claimed what is due!"
