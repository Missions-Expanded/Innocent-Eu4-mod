 ###MISSIONS###
 bng_taluqdar_zamindar_conflict_title: "End the Land Conflict"
 bng_taluqdar_zamindar_conflict_desc: "Conflicts between the Landed Muslims and Local Hindus have spilled over into the local Nobility, causing trouble in both court and land. The Zamindars claim divine guidance, as Allah would have wished, while the Taluqdars claim ancestral rights, which has been denied for years since the Ghurid and Delhian invasions. The Sultan choose his favourite, but it is possible to unite them both, either forcefully or with coercion." 
 bng_afghan_nobility_title: "Rights of the Afghans"
 bng_afghan_nobility_desc: "Like our forefathers, Delhi, we too have a sizable community of Afghan Nobles who have considerable political control over the country. But the constant threat of invasion and turmoil in the east have driven more and more towards Jaunpur, Bengal and other Sultanates who welcome them. Their influence grows, but many were warlords, who can easily help us in military reform."
 bng_procure_bombards_title: "Procuring Bombards"
 bng_procure_bombards_desc: "Bengal's supremacy can be attributed to their efficiency in the acquisition of artillery. Ban, Hawai and other rockets have been traveling on an easterly trajectory, and has now reached Bengal, where aspiring generals are looking for glory. Our continued cooperation with the Brokers must continue, lest we fall behind."
 bng_empower_paiks_title: "Readying the Paiks"
 bng_empower_paiks_desc: "The palace guards are numerous and strong. But their loyalty is questionable. Staffed by the Habshis, their proximity to the Sultan is worrying due to the affluence of the Harem, as times have proven that the Abyssinians are nothing but loyal to coin. It is better to staff them with more loyal, Muslim and local men, who are trained by the crown to serve the crown, and nothing else."
 bng_integrate_peasant_bands_title: "Integration of the Baksariyas"
 bng_integrate_peasant_bands_desc: "The Region of the Ganges is home to Massive populations of peasants that often find themselves out of work after war, due to their forced contributions by their Zamindars. They have formed peasant war bands in search of naukri, and have taken up moneylending as well, often at Bengali villages. This form of tribalism is proving disastrous, as anyone with enough mony could simply overrun the Sultanate, so it would be better to integrate these peasants into the army instead."
 bng_legacy_of_pala_title: "Legacy of the Palas"
 bng_legacy_of_pala_desc: "An empire that founded Bengal's administrative machinery, the Pala empire defined Bengali pluralism and central authority. Their heathen descent matters little to any Shah-i-Bangalah, who pride themselves on acceptance. Much of the Dhimmi look to the past empires as a bastion against the word of Allah, yet if we want to style ourselves as Bengali Rajas, and prevent another Raja Ganesha, religion must not divide Bangalah."
 bng_expand_mint_towns_title: "Expansion of Mint Towns"
 bng_expand_mint_towns_desc: "Bengal is home to the Taka, which has become the standard currency of trade for years, which has resulted in a greater demand for the coin. The area of the delta currently has 27 mint towns, with the most prominent being Mahmudabad, Khalifatabad, Satgaon and Firuzabad. These can easily be expanded to greater heights, supervised by our treasury, for the service of Indian Trade."
 bng_search_for_silver_title: "In Search of Silver"
 bng_search_for_silver_desc: "A growing empire needs a stable currency, one that can be minted and traded. While production continues to increase, resources become scarcer. Luckily, Burma lies close, where traders exchange Gold and Silver as a form of transaction. The city of Pegu houses many Bengali merchants who take part in local trade. Taking this city may provide us with the monopoly to ramp up Silver Production, and expand our trading links."
 bng_persian_immigrants_title: "Persian Immigration"
 bng_persian_immigrants_desc: "The form of government we proudly wear comes from Persia and the Persian world, like many Sultanates. This is seen through both Sassanian and Timurid imperial paradigm in court, as well as the lingua franca being Persian, making it easier to incorporate capable administrators into the harem. However, many other communities have seen this acceptance of easterly ways, and have begun immigrating into Bengal. Afghans, Pashtuns and Armenians. Most notably, after their expulsion, 40,000 Armenians have settled in Dhaka, adding to its already glamorous prestige, and are eagerly cashing in on the affluency local trade."
 bng_facilitate_trade_title: "Facilitating Trade Connections"
 bng_facilitate_trade_desc: "Bengali Merchants are seen all over the Indian Ocean, from the depths of Arabia, to the Porch of Mecca, The busy shipping routes between Basra and Malacca, and the islands of the Maldives. This is all thanks to heavy settlement in the city by both Bengalis and Persians. The port is also located in a natural harbour, and its links to Bengali sericulture make it a rich entrepot. These connections are wary, but true to Ma Huan's testimony, the flourishing seafaring industries can only grow."
 bng_cowry_shells_title: "Cowry Shell Trading"
 bng_cowry_shells_desc: "Bengal and the Maldives have enjoyed a beneficial relationship for decades, with shiploads of Cowry Shells being imported, subsidising the islands in return for currency. All large business transactions are done in terms of silver taka, while smaller purchases involve shell currency. However, with the arrival of the Europeans, the islands may possibly come under threat. We must make sure that the islands continue to stay under Bengali influence, even if they were to come into another country's hands. We rely on shiploads of cowry shell imports from the Maldives, so it would be beneficial to monopolise this important commodity, but it would cause no harm to maintain informal control."
 bng_maritime_silk_road_title: "Maritime Silk Road"
 bng_maritime_silk_road_desc: "Overland trade routes are frail, and subject to disaster, such as the plague, and the Mongol conquests. The shift to maritime trade has been inevitable, and sitting at the crossroads between the Arab world and China presents an opportunity. Instability in the Coromandel, and the arrival of the Ostend, East-Indian and French companies prove that trade will flow past Bengal, its now up to us to keep a clasp on the foreign traders."
 bng_inferno_title: "An Inferno Full of Gifts"
 bng_inferno_desc: "Despite Bengal's hot and tropical climate, trade has flourished to the extent that the Bay of Bengal is now the world's busiest and richest hub of trade. The Khorasanis once referred to the region as "An Inferno Full of Gifts", a description that is becoming more replaced by "Paradise of Nations". One thing for certain is that there is nothing like it."
 bng_mir_bahar_title: "Oversight by the Mir Bahar"
 bng_mir_bahar_desc: "Much of the Delta is easily accessible by ship, and requires constant policing. One benefit is that the riverine geography of the land has become accustomed to by Bengals seamen. who know the snaking distributaries better than no-one. Combined with a centralised authority who's job it is to build boats of all kinds for river transport, fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants, recruit efficient seamen and supervise the rivers, the Delta is as secure as ever."
 bng_royal_port_title: "Commission the Royal Port"
 bng_royal_port_desc: "Satgaon used to be the most important port of Bengal. The merchants of Satgaon did not have to leave their town and could earn fortune just staying home as the outside world came to them for trade. As the chief mart of Bengal, Satgaon attracted merchants from different parts of India and other countries. However, Satgaon is beginning to decline mainly due to the silting of the river Saraswati, which makes navigation extremely difficult. Already a centre of inland trade, Hughli is overtaking Satgaon, and has the benefit of being coastal and adjacent. With flourishing foreign trade being set up by the Portuguese, it will take little more than a royal decree to institute mercantile reform in the province."

 ### SCRIPTED EFFECTS ###


 ###EVENTS###
 
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.t: "The Armenians of Armanitola"
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.d: "The Armenian community of Dhaka were initially engaged in export trade paying a duty of 3.5% to the government. They lived in the neighborhoods of Moulbivazar and Nolgola, before moving to Armanitola. They have also sponsored and patronised the growth of education, establishing the Pogose School for less wealthy students.\n\nThe Armenians have quickly been expanding their prospects, controlling up to a quarter of the local textile trade, and monopolising the production of Jutes. While this is spur in production has done wonders for the traders of Dhaka, some are worried that their monopolistic attitude may harm the Bengali economy in the long run."
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.opt1: "The Ganges accepts everyone"
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.opt2: "We must protect the locals!"

 ME_Bengal_Events.2.t: "Standard Currency of Trade"
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.d: "Shipments of cowry shells fuel our economy, but they mainly come from the Maldives. Cowry shells act as a standard form of currency, replacing gold due to its rarity, and cowry's abundance. While large business transactions are done using the silver taka, smaller ones rely on these shells, so it is important to secure this trade."
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.opt1: "The islands are fine on their own, as long as they give us what we want"
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.opt2: "Allow local autonomy, but exercise limited control"
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.opt3: "Ensure crown control over the islands"

 ME_Bengal_Events.3.t: "Jamdani Dhakai"
 ME_Bengal_Events.3.d: "'The City of Dhaka is a very large, spacious one, but stands on low, marshy, swampy ground, and the water of that ground is very brackish, which is the only inconvenience. It has, however, some very fine conveniences that compensate, having a very fine and large river that runs close by the city walls, navigable by ships of 500 or 600 tonnes burden. The water of the river, being an arm of the Ganges, is extraordinarily good, but is some distance for fetching and carrying for some residents of the city, the city being not less than 40 English miles in circumference. It is an admirable city for its greatness, for its magnificent buildings, and the multitude of its inhabitants. A very great and potent, permanent, and paid army is based here, in a constant state of readiness. Also, many large, strong, and stately elephants, trained for battle, which are kept close to the palace.'\n\n Dhaka is home to a large community of cloth weavers who have over time become extremely skilled in their craft. around 80,000 of the city is employed in the industry, producing mainly muslin and Jamdani, a unique weave that has become synonoymous with Dhakan cloth."
