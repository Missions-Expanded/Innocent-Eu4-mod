 ###MISSIONS###
 bng_taluqdar_zamindar_conflict_title: "End the Land Conflict"
 bng_taluqdar_zamindar_conflict_desc: "Conflicts between the Landed Muslims and Local Hindus have spilled over into the local Nobility, causing trouble in both court and land. The Zamindars claim divine guidance, as Allah would have wished, while the Taluqdars claim ancestral rights, which has been denied for years since the Ghurid and Delhian invasions. The Sultan choose his favourite, but it is possible to unite them both, either forcefully or with coercion." 
 bng_afghan_nobility_title: "Rights of the Afghans"
 bng_afghan_nobility_desc: "Like our forefathers, Delhi, we too have a sizable community of Afghan Nobles who have considerable political control over the country. But the constant threat of invasion and turmoil in the east have driven more and more towards Jaunpur, Bengal and other Sultanates who welcome them. Their influence grows, but many were warlords, who can easily help us in military reform."
 bng_procure_bombards_title: "Procuring Bombards"
 bng_procure_bombards_desc: "Bengal's supremacy can be attributed to their efficiency in the acquisition of artillery. Ban, Hawai and other rockets have been traveling on an easterly trajectory, and has now reached Bengal, where aspiring generals are looking for glory. Our continued cooperation with the Brokers must continue, lest we fall behind."
 bng_empower_paiks_title: "Readying the Paiks"
 bng_empower_paiks_desc: "The palace guards are numerous and strong. But their loyalty is questionable. Staffed by the Habshis, their proximity to the Sultan is worrying due to the affluence of the Harem, as times have proven that the Abyssinians are nothing but loyal to coin. It is better to staff them with more loyal, Muslim and local men, who are trained by the crown to serve the crown, and nothing else."
 bng_integrate_peasant_bands_title: "Integration of the Baksariyas"
 bng_integrate_peasant_bands_desc: "The Region of the Ganges is home to Massive populations of peasants that often find themselves out of work after war, due to their forced contributions by their Zamindars. They have formed peasant war bands in search of naukri, and have taken up moneylending as well, often at Bengali villages. This form of tribalism is proving disastrous, as anyone with enough mony could simply overrun the Sultanate, so it would be better to integrate these peasants into the army instead."
 bng_legacy_of_pala_title: "Legacy of the Palas"
 bng_legacy_of_pala_desc: "An empire that founded Bengal's administrative machinery, the Pala empire defined Bengali pluralism and central authority. Their heathen descent matters little to any Shah-i-Bangalah, who pride themselves on acceptance. Much of the Dhimmi look to the past empires as a bastion against the word of Allah, yet if we want to style ourselves as Bengali Rajas, and prevent another Raja Ganesha, religion must not divide Bangalah."
 bng_expand_mint_towns_title: "Expansion of Mint Towns"
 bng_expand_mint_towns_desc: "Bengal is home to the Taka, which has become the standard currency of trade for years, which has resulted in a greater demand for the coin. The area of the delta currently has 27 mint towns, with the most prominent being Mahmudabad, Khalifatabad, Satgaon and Firuzabad. These can easily be expanded to greater heights, supervised by our treasury, for the service of Indian Trade."
 bng_search_for_silver_title: "In Search of Silver"
 bng_search_for_silver_desc: "A growing empire needs a stable currency, one that can be minted and traded. While production continues to increase, resources become scarcer. Luckily, Burma lies close, where traders exchange Gold and Silver as a form of transaction. The city of Pegu houses many Bengali merchants who take part in local trade. Taking this city may provide us with the monopoly to ramp up Silver Production, and expand our trading links."
 bng_persian_immigrants_title: "Persian Immigration"
 bng_persian_immigrants_desc: "The form of government we proudly wear comes from Persia and the Persian world, like many Sultanates. This is seen through both Sassanian and Timurid imperial paradigm in court, as well as the lingua franca being Persian, making it easier to incorporate capable administrators into the harem. However, many other communities have seen this acceptance of easterly ways, and have begun immigrating into Bengal. Afghans, Pashtuns and Armenians. Most notably, after their expulsion, 40,000 Armenians have settled in Dhaka, adding to its already glamorous prestige, and are eagerly cashing in on the affluency local trade."
 bng_facilitate_trade_title: "Facilitating Trade Connections"
 bng_facilitate_trade_desc: "Bengali Merchants are seen all over the Indian Ocean, from the depths of Arabia, to the Porch of Mecca, The busy shipping routes between Basra and Malacca, and the islands of the Maldives. This is all thanks to heavy settlement in the city by both Bengalis and Persians. The port is also located in a natural harbour, and its links to Bengali sericulture make it a rich entrepot. These connections are wary, but true to Ma Huan's testimony, the flourishing seafaring industries can only grow."
 bng_cowry_shells_title: "Cowry Shell Trading"
 bng_cowry_shells_desc: "Bengal and the Maldives have enjoyed a beneficial relationship for decades, with shiploads of Cowry Shells being imported, subsidising the islands in return for currency. All large business transactions are done in terms of silver taka, while smaller purchases involve shell currency. However, with the arrival of the Europeans, the islands may possibly come under threat. We must make sure that the islands continue to stay under Bengali influence, even if they were to come into another country's hands. We rely on shiploads of cowry shell imports from the Maldives, so it would be beneficial to monopolise this important commodity, but it would cause no harm to maintain informal control."

 ME_Bengal_Events.1.t: "The Armenians of Armanitola"
 ME_Bengal_Events.1.d: "The Armenian community of Dhaka were initially engaged in export trade paying a duty of 3.5% to the government. They lived in the neighborhoods of Moulbivazar and Nolgola, before moving to Armanitola. They have also sponsored and patronised the growth of education, establishing the Pogose School for less wealthy students.\n\nThe Armenians have quickly been expanding their prospects, controlling up to a quarter of the local textile trade, and monopolising the production of Jutes. While this is spur in production has done wonders for the traders of Dhaka, some are worried that their monopolistic attitude may harm the Bengali economy in the long run."

 ME_Bengal_Events.1.opt2: "We must protect the locals!"

 ME_Bengal_Events.2.t: "Standard Currency of Trade"
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.d: "Shipments of cowry shells fuel our economy, but they mainly come from the Maldives. Cowry shells act as a standard form of currency, replacing gold due to its rarity, and cowry's abundance. While large business transactions are done using the silver taka, smaller ones rely on these shells, so it is important to secure this trade."
 ME_Bengal_Events.2.opt1: "The islands are fine on their own, as long as they give us what we want"

In an admirable effort to gain favour of the sultan, he has translated the Sultan into the book, and complimented him as 'Nrpati-Tilak' and 'Jaga-Bhusan'. The only question is, which part do we stylise ourselves as?"

 bng_events.23.d: "Since the founding of the Sultanate, many rulers have plegged resources to the heart of Islam in arabia. one such institution is called the 'Ghiyathiyyah Madrasah', a Madrasah built by Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah during his reign.

 bng_events.33.d: "'Glory to the Shri Krishna sankirtana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death. That sankirtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.'\n\n'In your names manifested various kinds of full potencies (shaktis) therein bestowed, with no rules according to time for remembering them, O Lord, you are so merciful, but it is my misfortune here that I have no anuraga in those names.'\n\nBorn in 1486, Chaitanya had always been infatuated with Krishna, a Hindu deity, and became fluent in sanskrit. He created teachings and became a devotee, for his life was devoted to establishing Gaudi Vaishnavism. To our muslim rule, his teachings are seen as tolerable at best, and blasphemy by the more extreme sects of our society. However, he is deemed a saint by the majority of our population, who happen to be hindus.\n\nChaitanya has begun influencing our cabinet, causing many of our administrators to follow his teachings, and his influence may endear us to the local populace, but a growing and resurgence in hindu power may hinder us in the long run."

How will this be possible if the line comes to an end?'\n\n Krittivas Ramayan was written by Krittibas Ojha, a great Bengali poet.

 bng_habshi_events.1.t: "The Habshis of Bengal"
 bng_habshi_events.1.d: "Habshis are notorious warriors and mercenaries, originating in East Africa. Throughout the years, they have proven useful in wars and providing useful political leverage for the Sultan, and many Indian states. There has been worry recently, as the increasing fragility of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty has also increased the power of the Habshis, with some fearing coup attempts and land seizure. While many dismiss this as simple fearmongering, it would be wise to stay weary of their growing power."
 bng_habshi_events.1.opt1: "Coups?! Nonsense! They are allied to nothing but money, which we have lots of."

 bng_habshi_events.2.t: "Habshis request Noble titles"
 bng_habshi_events.2.d: "The arrival of the Habshis have irritated some of our nobles, who argue that the intoduction of foreigners into our lands may upend the local establishment, causing a bit of a ruckus. We could try accomodating the Habshis, providing us with some monetary benefits and ridding us of the worst nobles, but this may upset the whole of the nobility"
 bng_habshi_events.2.opt1: "Grant them the titles"
 bng_habshi_events.2.opt2: "Refuse them the titles"
 
 bng_habshi_events.3.t: "Habshis Propose Clerical Seizures"
 bng_habshi_events.3.d: "Many of the Habshis that we have hired come from East Africa, with many also being hardline muslims, preaching conservative and pious sects that are less than accepted in Bengal. They have proposed seizing some of our priest's lands, as a way of enforcing Islams word in Bengal, which may upset some of our mystics."
 bng_habshi_events.3.opt1: "By all means, anything for Bengal"
 bng_habshi_events.3.opt2: "The Church shall remain entrusted with their land"
 bng_habshi_events.3.opt3: "Perhaps we can grant some titles to the Rajputs instead?"

 bng_habshi_events.4.t: "Promising Habshi Advisor"
 bng_habshi_events.4.d: "It's not just men that are being bought. Some of the slave soldiers have seen countless conflicts, requiring them to adapt towards many circumstances. One such man has made an offer to become a military advisor for our mercenaries. This may seem sketchy, especially for our aristocrats who have traditionally led the army, but this may benefit us no matter what the nobility says."
 bng_habshi_events.4.opt1: "We could use some more bright minds"
 bng_habshi_events.4.opt2: "A Foreigner? in MY court!?"

 bng_habshi_events.5.t: "Habshis request military patronage"
 bng_habshi_events.5.d: "A prestigious nation can easily make a few sacrifices when needed. That is why a man has approached us. He was purchased as a soldier, but has suggested that we fund some military programs for improving our combat ability. He appears sketchy, and many are advising against it, but he has a certain charm..."
 bng_habshi_events.5.opt1: "Sure, why not. You've got to break a few eggs"
 bng_habshi_events.5.opt2: "Turn him away; what a laughable suggestion"

 bng_habshi_events.6.t: "A Habshi High Command?"
 bng_habshi_events.6.d: "The large amount of control our nobility has on the army worries the sultan. While he feels that the Paiks are well trained, he also feels as if they are loyal more to coin than word, and is on edge as tensions have beem growing. There is a possibility of dividing power to strengthen the Sultanate, by allowing some of the Habshis to form a high command, and advise us on our war plans, weakening the nobles, but strengthening the abyssinians"
 bng_habshi_events.6.opt1: "Allow the Habshi High command"
 bng_habshi_events.6.opt2: "No man of non-noble blood sets foot near our generalty"

 bng_habshi_events.7.t: "Habshis demand religious conversion"
 bng_habshi_events.7.d: "Many habshis come from more conservative areas of islam, meaning that anything heretical or heathen is deemed worth killing over. Some soldiers dislike the religious freedom granted to many Hindus, and seek to convert them, either diplomatically or violently. Should we give in?"
 bng_habshi_events.7.opt1: "The infidels must be purged!"
 bng_habshi_events.7.opt2: "The hindus are our friends, so be careful what you say...""

 bng_habshi_events.8.t: "Word of Coups..."
 bng_habshi_events.8.d: "The growing power of the Habshis cannot be ignored any more. They are in our cabinet, our army and even staff the palace guards. Many nobles have informed us of a possible coup, which is not without merit. A choice may arrise, whether the Habshis prove to be the best for bengal, or if they must be expelled"
 bng_habshi_events.8.opt1: "We must be vigilant for the future" 

 bng_habshi_events.9.t: "Habshi Coup!"
 bng_habshi_events.9.d: "The Habshis have assasinated our Sultan!. The palace guards stormed the Sultans quarters, and have murdered him in cold blood!. This is unacceptable, and we must decide on how we must approach this!"
 bng_habshi_events.9.opt1: "The Habshis know the way for Bengal"
 bng_habshi_events.9.opt2: "Preposterous, organise a Counter-coup!"

 bng_habshi_events.10.t: "The plot disintegrates!"
 bng_habshi_events.10.d: "The low influence of the Habshis meant that our spymasters could easily root out the troublemakers, showing Bengal what we have been paying for. There is now no threat to the throne!"
 bng_habshi_events.10.opt1: "The future looks bright for Bengal" 

 bng_habshi_events.11.t: "The Dust Settles!"
 bng_habshi_events.11.d: "The rebels have been defeated, and the throne of Bengal is secure once more. We are now able to lead the Sultanate to its true destiny!"
