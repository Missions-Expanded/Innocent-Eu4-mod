Now we have two choices, climb it from the inside, playing the game of thrones and cards to become the next Emperor and liberate Italy from the meddling of this barbarians, showing them the glory of Lombardy, or destroy its influence in Italy once and for all, unite all Italians under one flag and rule what is rightfully ours."

 ME_Milan_Events.3.D: "Already in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Milan was one of the most important centers in Europe for the production of weapons and armor, with over a hundred shops of armorari and gunsmiths active. The production capacity of the city was such that after the defeat of Maclodio (1427), just two families of gunsmiths were able to provide in a few days to two thousand armor for infantry and four thousand harnesses for horses for the soldiers released from Carmagnola. It was in the fifteenth century that the city achieved primacy thanks to the invention of the complete armor of plates "Milanese style" (the most common along with the Gothic). \nMilanese plate armor was exported all over Europe; under Francesco Sforza and Galeazzo Maria Sforza they were bought by Louis XI of France and by Ludovico IX of Bavaria. The Milanese armorari were also masters in the decoration of armor. \nEach armoraro or gunsmith signed their products with brands usually bearing their initials combined with a seal. The availability of armor was so remarkable that on the occasion of the wedding procession of Ludovico il Moro and Beatrice d'Este, the Milanese gunsmiths placed a double row of armor on fake horses equally harnessed along the districts of the Spadari and Armorari. The skill of these armorari was such that the Sforza family forbade them to move out of the Duchy (ducal decree of 9 October 1448). \nIn addition to weapons and armor, Milan was also renowned for the production of bits, stirrups, reins, saddles, spurs so that there were about eighty farriers as well as thirty founders of bells and rattles with which the necks of horses were decorated and which seem to be an exclusive production of the city."

 ME_Milan_Events.5.T: "A Dynasty Proposal"
 ME_Milan_Events.5.D: "Iberia, throughout it's history has maintained a strong relation with the Holy Roman Empire for many reasons. The most important reasons of all is the establishment of a united front against the French threat. With the ascendance of Lombardy as the new hegemon in Holy Roman affairs, we have found ourselves in a new predicament. We can devise a political marriage, insuring our long lasting alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and lose our Iberian dynasty in the process, or we stay supportive to our local dynasty but anger the newly ascended hegemon."
 ME_Milan_Events.5.OPT1: "Accept the proposal"
 ME_Milan_Events.5.OPT2: "Reject the proposal"
