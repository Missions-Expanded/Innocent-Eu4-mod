As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk, the law runneth forward and back; for the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.' These wise natives were, rather ironically, found dead three days later from a wolf attack."
 ME.Castile_Events.2.a: "We shall discard this knowledge."
