 ragusa_balkan_latin_republic_desc: "In 1358, following a war with the Kingdom of Hungary, Venice was forced to renounce most of its possessions in Dalmatia with the peace of Zadar. Ragusa took the opportunity to free itself from the Venetian yoke and voluntarily gave itself as a vassal to the Kingdom of Hungary. \nObtained the right of self-government in exchange for the bond of assistance with its own fleet and the payment of an annual tribute to the king of Hungary, Ragusa began its history as an independent state. At that time the city was fortified and equipped with two ports. In the mid-fifteenth century the Communitas Ragusina began to be called Respublica Ragusina. In the same years, also the federated city of Ragusa, Ancona, passed from the denomination Comunitas Anconae to that of Respublica Anconitana."

 ragusa_shores_dalmatia_desc: "The loss of the Dalmatian provinces to Hungary and Venice has weakened our position for far too long, it is our duty to free our brethern from the Venetian's wrecked fingers lingering only to increase their profits exploiting ourselves."

 ragusa_safe_adriatic_balkans_desc: "The colonies in Dalmatia and Albania were united by the same structural feature, constituted as they were, in most cases, by an urban center and the territory dependent on it, which in some cases included smaller urban centers with their respective territories, and even some islands. Zadar, seat of a Latin archbishopric, was considered the metropolis of Dalmatia."
 ragusa_northern_adriatic_coast_title: "Northern Adriatic Coast"
 ragusa_northern_adriatic_coast_desc: "Despite the gloom of the picture often painted by the descriptions of the Venetian rectors, Istria, Dalmatia and the possessions on the Albanian coasts were still able to supply Venice and the other territories with considerable quantities of agricultural products and raw materials, such as wine, salt, salted meat and fish, leathers from the Balkan hinterland, timber and building materials, such as the famous Istrian stone used for the construction of many Venetian palaces. And they also had manufacturing centers: at the Recanati fairs large quantities of "rasse", "sarze" and "grisi" - lower quality fabrics produced in Dalmatia and Istria are sold."
 ragusa_defying_doge_title: "Defying the Doge"
 ragusa_defying_doge_desc: "The infamous Doge wants to strecth its wicked fingers on all the Adriatic sea and consolidate Venice as the dominant trading power but this won't happen, after the accidents occurred in the Adriatic Sea we must strenghten our navy, set sail and destroy the Arsenal of the red winged lion!"

 ragusa_fleet_expansion_title: "Fleet Expansion"
 ragusa_fleet_expansion_desc: "Our fleet is shameful. It serves its purpose, yes, but compared to the mighty merchant fleet of Venice or even Genoa it is pathetic. We don't even play second fiddle to the Venetian merchants. This cannot stand. In the maritine trade we need to be at the top of our game. In the Adriatic Sea our merchants need to dominate, and to do that we need a merchant fleet fitting for our merchants."
 ragusa_maritime_republics_title: "Maritime Republics"
 ragusa_maritime_republics_desc: "Our sister republics have been subjugated, their independence removed finally with only the Ragusa standing tall as the most sublime of the republics...\n\n And yet, despite our victory over our fellow merchant republics, even we have to admit we can't rule the cities with an iron fist. Ragusa can't rule alone in the Mediterranean sea. It needs its sister cities to dominate. We shall divert funds and state attention towards enhancing our sister cities in Italy. Though they are part of Ragusa their importance to the Ragusan trade will be prelevalent in years to come. They shall help us, if with a bit of force, to usher in the Ragusan golden age."

 ragusa_masters_of_commerce_desc: "Peculiarity of the republic of Ragusa was the presence of its own consuls not only in other ports, but in numerous centers far from the sea, along the roads that crossed the Balkan peninsula in an east-west direction. Consulates of Ragusa were in fact in: Mostar, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Belgrade, Prizren, Pristina, Prokuplje, Niš, Novi Pazar, Sofia, Plovdiv, Adrianople, Provadija. Naturally, the Ragusa consuls also sent consuls to the maritime outlets of these trade routes: Varna, Salonicco, and Constantinople (Ragusa also had its own warehouses in the latter two centers). Naturally a Ragusa consulate was present in the sister republic of Ancona, from which the Balkan goods took the road to Florence, Lombardy and Flanders. In the Adriatic, Ragusa consuls were also in the opposite ports of Barletta, Trani and Bari. In the Levant Ragusa consulates were in Chios, Rhodes, Candia and Alexandria in Egypt.

 ragusa_new_republic_title: "New Republic"
 ragusa_new_republic_desc: "The main factor on which the entire economic life of the Republic depended was in fact maritime trade, at a time when the mainland was still largely foreign to it, if not hostile. By maintaining its dominion in Dalmatia, Ragusa was at the same time satisfying three essential requirements of its politics. Also for this reason this vital connection and the set of problems that arose in this period in the Dalmatian area cannot fail to be at the center of our attention, especially since through their analysis the profile of the Venetian attitude towards all the Adriatic areas."

 ragusa_city_ancona_title: "City of Ancona"
 ragusa_city_ancona_desc: "Commercial competition among Venice, Ancona and Ragusa was very strong because all of them bordered the Adriatic Sea. They fought open battles on more than one occasion. Venice, aware of its major economic and military power, disliked competition from other maritime cities in the Adriatic. Several Adriatic ports were under Venetian rule, but Ancona and Ragusa retained their independence. To avoid succumbing to Venetian rule, these two republics made multiple lasting alliances. \n\nVenice conquered Ragusa in 1205 and held it until 1382 when Ragusa regained de facto freedom, paying tributes first to the Hungarians, and after the Battle of Mohács, to the Ottoman Empire. During this period Ragusa reconfirmed its old alliance with Ancona."

The gospari (the aristocracy) kept the dalmatic for a few decades, but its use decreased until it disappeared. \nAt the end of the 14th century the majority of the inhabitants of the republic spoke Croatian, and its use gradually increased until it became common to all social strata of the city.
