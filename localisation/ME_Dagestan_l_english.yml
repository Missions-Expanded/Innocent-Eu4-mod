 dagestan_shamkhal_levy_system_desc: "A standing army requires soldiers to fight. Because professional soldiers are in short supply, we should begin relying on feudal levies to carry out war.

 dagestan_permanent_roads_title: "Permanent Roads"
 dagestan_permanent_roads_desc: "Despite advancements in communication, travel through the Caucasus is still extremely difficult, by no means a reliable undergoing.
