 tts_granary_kingdom_title: "Granary of the Kingdom"
 tts_granary_kingdom_desc: "In the Bourbon kingdom, as in the other pre-unification states, agriculture was the predominant sector. The climatic conditions of the Two Sicilies favored the production of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, legumes and oil. Also important were the cultivation of citrus fruits and many other plants suitable for the Mediterranean climate, such as the olive tree, the vine, the fig, the cherry, the chestnut, the hazelnut, the walnut and the almond tree. Areas very exploited for the cultivation of fruit trees were for example the countryside around Vesuvius. The breeding was mainly sheep (wool), horses and pigs."

 tts_army_two_sicilies_title: "Army of the Two Sicilies"
 tts_army_two_sicilies_desc: "All that was needed by the army was built or provided in the Kingdom. The metallurgical material for artillery was manufactured at Mongiana, cannons were melted in Naples, rifles were made in Torre Annunziata, machines for war wood were made in Pietrarsa, powders in Scafati, and a fireworks factory in Capua and in Naples a topographical office, directed by the colonel of the genius Visconti, a mathematician of great value. In Castelnuovo there was an ancient and modern armory, quite important."
 tts_real_esercito_title: "Real Esercito"
 tts_real_esercito_desc: "The Neapolitan soldier is lively, intelligent, daring, and in a very imaginative one; and yet easy to exalt and run to the most daring enterprises, but easy to run away. He easily submits to discipline, when this moves from a just power, strong and constant. The elementary education of the different weapons is excellent: they maneuver exactly and promptly, both separate and united; The Neapolitan and Sicilian military institutions boast a much older history, which has its foundations in the organization of a "state-owned" (ie state and no longer feudal) army by Ferrante d Aragon in 1464. In particular, the Spanish viceregal period (1503-1714) profoundly marked the military customs of the subsequent Bourbon period. During this time the soldiers of southern Italy were in fact involved in almost all the military events of the Spanish Empire (from the wars of Charles V to the wars of Flanders, from the colonial campaigns in America to the thirty years war), often giving proof of great value and loyalty to the imperial authorities. The captains, belonging to the best feudal nobility of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces, were able to frame and prepare the subjects of the two viceroys for war, obeying the firm political direction given by the monarchs of Spain."

 tts_dream_ruggero_title: "Dream of Ruggero"
 tts_dream_ruggero_desc: "Since the dawn of the first pilgrimages to Southern Italy in the 11th century, the desire for unity of the provinces of Naples, Puglia, Calabria and Sicily has always been present in our ancestors and kings, since the first of us all, Ruggero II of Altavilla. \nToday is a special day, under the guidance of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we have been able to unify the most breathtaking lands that Italy can offer, enriched by a millenary culture that has seen in itself a union of unrivaled knowledge in Mediterranean. \nFacite ammuina! We celebrate and sing, as today is a wonderful day for all of us."
 tts_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 tts_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 tts_army_sea_title: "Army of the Sea"
 tts_army_sea_desc: "The recruitment of sailors was too concentrated in Campania and in some (few) areas of northern Sicily, without either a sort of coastal lever / militia on the French seventeenth-century model (which would have involved the whole Kingdom), or press-gangs on the British model (which would have involved all ports), while the officers were always also gentlemen by birth, with a substantial differentiation between navigators and fighters, based on the anachronistic model of the Spanish navy (but also in this case the Acton intended to introduce the British model , meritocratic). However, the Bourbon navy was always understaffed in terms of personnel and many ships were decidedly "empty" compared to those of other European powers."
 tts_real_marina_title: "Real Marina"
 tts_real_marina_desc: "During the first decade of the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Sicilian naval forces therefore included only one vessel, the S. Filippo-the Royal, the frigate S. Carlo-the Partenope, and the four galleys S. Gennaro, Concezione, S. Antonio and Capitana , in addition to some minor wood. \nAt the same time the Marine Infantry Corps was established, the first in Italy designed to operate on board warships together with crews; later on his duties also included the supervision of naval bases. \nOur attempt to unite the Italian peninsula and creating a fleet to dominate the others seas should start with the creation of the largest navy the Mediterranean has ever seen."

 tts_tonnare_siciliane_title: "Tonnare Siciliane"
 tts_tonnare_siciliane_desc: "Fishing was a traditionally widespread activity on all the coasts of the kingdom. It assumed an industrial character above all thanks to the work of Vincenzo Florio, who in Sicily was also very active in this field (in addition to those of the chemical, steel, textile and maritime transport industries), building traps and factories for processing and conservation of the catch."
 tts_protecting_sea_zones_title: "Protecting the Sea Zones"
 tts_protecting_sea_zones_desc: "The merchant navy was made up almost entirely of small woods, good for cabotage and fishing, and more than 40,000 sailors mounted it, a number inadequate for the tonnage of the ships. Navigation was limited to the coasts of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, and the slow progress of the maritime forces did not consist in decreasing the number of logs and increasing their range, but in multiplying the small ships. The steam merchant navy was very scarce, despite the fact that one of the first steamships, which plowed the waters of the Mediterranean, was built in Naples in 1818. It apparently seemed the largest in Italy, while in reality the Sardinian was inferior, and also as a warship, it was scarce for a Kingdom, of which the third part was formed by Sicily and the other two thirds formed a large pier launched towards the Levant. The navy and the army were at the antipodes: the army was disproportionate to the country for exuberance, the navy for deficiency."

In fact, under his guidance, the need to create specialized institutes for the training of officers of various weapons was identified for the first time: this initiative was necessary to free the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from subjection to the Kingdom of Spain, governed by Philip V, and to limit the ambitions of his mother Elisabetta Farnese. \n\nThe new united army of the [Root.GetName] must be reformed, but on which of our many traditions and encounters shall be base the core of our new army?"

 tts_royal_palace_title: "Reggia di Caserta"
 tts_royal_palace_desc: "The location is of exceptional beauty, in the most luxuriant plain in the world, but with extensive gardens that extend to the hills; an aqueduct leads you to an entire river, which waters the palace and its surroundings, and this water mass it can transform, pouring it on artificial rocks, into a wonderful waterfall. The gardens are beautiful and harmonize very much with this district which is a single garden. \nThe Royal Palace of Caserta was wanted by the King of Sicily [Root.Monarch.GetName], who, taken from a competition with the French royals and eager to donate structures to Naples that could play the role of the capital city of European level, he decided to inaugurate a palace that could rival in magnificence and grandeur with those of the European capitals. For safety reasons, the chosen location was Casertavecchia about 15 km north of the capital. \nThe king asked that the project include, in addition to the palace, the park and the arrangement of the surrounding urban area, with the supply from a new aqueduct (Acquedotto Carolino) that would cross the annexed complex of San Leucio. The new palace was to be a symbol of the new Bourbon state and to show power and grandeur, but also to be efficient and rational. \nThe project was part of the broader political plan of king [Root.Monarch.GetName], who probably also wanted to move some administrative structures of the state to the new Royal Palace, connecting it to the capital Naples with a monumental avenue of over 15 km."
 tts_maschio_angioino_title: "Maschio Angioino"
 tts_maschio_angioino_desc: "The presence of an external monarchy had set the urban planning of Naples around the center of royal power, constituting an alternative urban center, formed by the port and the two main adjacent castles, Castel Capuano and Castel dell'Ovo. This relationship between the royal court and town planning had already manifested itself with Frederick II, who in the 13th century, in the Swabian statute, had concentrated the greatest attention on castles, neglecting the city walls at all. To the two existing castles the Angevins added the main one, Castel Nuovo (Chastiau neuf), which was not only a fortification but above all their grandiose palace. \nThe royal residence of Naples had until then been Castel Capuano, but the ancient Norman fortress was judged inadequate for its function and the king wanted to build a new castle near the sea. \nAssigned the project to the French architect Pierre de Chaulnes, the works for the construction of the Castrum Novum began in 1279 and ended just three years later, a very short time given the construction techniques of the time and the overall size of the work. However, the king never resided there: following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers, which cost Angioino the crown of Sicily, conquered by Peter III of Aragon and other events, the new palace remained unused until 1285, the year of his death. by Carlo I. \nAlfonso of Aragon, who had conquered the throne of Naples in 1443, wanted to establish in the castle the function of the center of royal power and a court of magnificence that could compete with that of Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence. The fortress was completely rebuilt in its present form. King Alfonso entrusted the renovation of the old Angevin palace-fortress to an Aragonese architect, Guillem Sagrera, a Catalan from Mallorca, who conceived it in Gothic-Catalan terms. \nThe five round towers, four of which incorporated the previous Angevin towers with a square plan, more suitable for withstanding the shots of the guns of the time, reaffirmed the defensive role of the castle. The importance of the building as a center of royal power was instead underlined by the insertion of the triumphal arch at its entrance, a masterpiece of the Neapolitan Renaissance and the work of Francesco Laurana as well as many artists of various origins."
 tts_union_of_crowns_title: "Union of the Crowns"
 tts_union_of_crowns_desc: "The Kingdom of Sicily, born in 1130, began to be referred to as the Kingdom of Sicily beyond the lighthouse (or further) and the Kingdom of Sicily on this side of the lighthouse (or higher), in reference to the lighthouse of Messina and therefore to the close homonym, in 1268 when Charles I of Anjou crowned by Pope Clement IV rex Siciliae, transferred the capital to Naples and the Sicilian nobility claimed this title for themselves, supporting the requests of Peter III of Aragon and thus starting the war of the Vespers . The peace of Caltabellotta, in 1302, sanctioned the end of the war and gave the aforementioned separation (according to the agreements, on the death of the Aragonese king Frederick of Aragon, the island should have returned to the Angevins, which in reality did not happen)."
 tts_pizza_title: "'A Pizza"
 tts_pizza_desc: "The most ordinary pizzas called coll'aglio e l'oglio, have oil for seasoning, and over it is spread salt, oregano and minced garlic cloves. Others are covered with grated cheese and seasoned with lard, and then a few basil leaves are placed on top. To the first, small fish is often added; to the second thin slices of muzzarella. Sometimes use is made of sliced ham, tomatoes, clams, etc. Sometimes folding the pasta on itself forms what is called calzone. \nThis culinary beauty has been spread all over the world for its practical use and divine goodness."
 tts_king_jerusalem_title: "King of Jerusalem"
 tts_king_jerusalem_desc: "The kingdom of Jerusalem originated following the first crusade, when the Christian army led by Godfrey of Bouillon conquered the Holy City (July 15, 1099). Godfrey, after renouncing the royal title, obtained that of Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Protector of the Holy Sepulcher) and was crowned Governor of Jerusalem in the Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem. \nAt his death the following year, his brother Baldwin was the first of the rulers to be crowned with the title of king of Jerusalem. The ceremony took place in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The exact formula of the royal title was Rex Latinorum Hierosolymitanus, ie \"King of the Latins of Jerusalem\", meaning that the sovereign's jurisdiction did not include the native populations: Christian, Muslim and Jewish. \nThe succession to the throne of Jerusalem generally took place according to both hereditary and elective criteria. Even when the title was inherited within the same ruling family, the sovereign always received validation from the Jerusalem High Court. The king was in fact considered a primus inter pares (first among equals) rather than a real monarch, so much so that in his absence the functions of government were entrusted to his officers."
 tts_duomo_monreale_title: "Duomo di Monreale"
 tts_duomo_monreale_desc: "According to legend, William II the Good, who succeeded his father on the throne of Sicily, would have fallen asleep under a carob tree, overwhelmed by fatigue, while hunting in the woods of Monreale. In a dream the Madonna appeared to him, to whom he was very devoted, who revealed the secret of a \"truvatura\" with these words: \"In the place where you are sleeping the greatest treasure in the world is hidden: unearth it and build a temple in my honor ". Having said these words, the Virgin disappeared and William, confident of the revelation in a dream, ordered that the carob be uprooted and dug around it. With great amazement, a treasure in gold coins was discovered which were immediately destined for the construction of the Cathedral of Monreale, to which Greek-Byzantine mosaic masters (“the masters of the oru”) of the interior were called for the realization."
 tts_parramentu_sicilianu_title: "Parlamento del Regno di Sicilia"
 tts_parramentu_sicilianu_desc: "The Sicilian parliament was made up of three "branches" ("feudal", "ecclesiastical" and "state property"). The feudal branch was made up of the noble representatives of counties and baronies, the ecclesiastical branch was made up of archbishops, bishops, abbots and archimandrites, while the state branch was made up of representatives of the 42 state-owned cities of Sicily. The first Norman parliament was not deliberative, and had only a consultative and ratification function of the sovereign's activity, especially in taxation, in the economy and in the management of relations with foreign powers. The deputies were chosen from among the most powerful nobles. The first radical change took place with Frederick II of Swabia, who also allowed partial access to civil society, such as state-owned cities. Federico gathered a parliament in September 1221 in Messina known as the "Assise di Messina", where he proceeded to reorganize the legislation of the Regnum by promulgating a further nucleus of assisae, four or five, conceived to defend morality, order and "good customs "of the Kingdom", the first nucleus of those that in 1231 would have been promulgated in Melfi as Constitutionum Regni Siciliarum, then integrated into the Syracuse assembly in 1233."
 tts_university_federico_II_title: "Università Federico II"
 tts_university_federico_II_desc: "The erection of the Studium was decreed by Emperor Frederick II of Swabia on 5 June (5 July according to some sources) 1224 through a circular letter (generalis lictera) sent from Syracuse. Since it was created at the behest of the emperor, the University of Naples is considered by far the first lay university in Europe of a state type (not founded, that is, by corporations or associations of intellectuals, or students, but by virtue of a provision sovereign). \nInitially the studies were directed towards law (fundamental for the training of jurists), the liberal arts, medicine and theology: the latter, compared to other subjects, was taught in religious centers, in particular in the convent of San Domenico Maggiore , where Thomas Aquinas taught from 1271 to 1274. During the Angevin period (1265-1443) the structure and organization of the University remained substantially unchanged. \nFurthermore, during the Angevin period the University of Naples, unlike the others, remained independent from papal power: in fact, Charles I of Anjou reaffirmed and increased the previous privileges granted by the Swabian kings to the University. The first difficulties came with the advent of the Aragonese dominion in 1443, which in fact forced the university to a first closure."
