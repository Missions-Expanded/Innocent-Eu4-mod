 tts_real_esercito_title: "Real Esercito"
 tts_real_esercito_desc: "\"The Neapolitan soldier is lively, intelligent, daring, and in a very imaginative one; and yet easy to exalt and run to the most daring enterprises, but easy to run away. He easily submits to discipline, when this moves from a just power, strong and constant. The elementary education of the different weapons is excellent: they maneuver exactly and promptly, both separate and united;\" \nAlthough the Royal Army was built only in 1734, the Neapolitan and Sicilian military institutions boast a much older history, which has its foundations in the organization of a "state-owned" (ie state and no longer feudal) army by Ferrante d Aragon in 1464. In particular, the Spanish viceregal period (1503-1714) profoundly marked the military customs of the subsequent Bourbon period. During this time the soldiers of southern Italy were in fact involved in almost all the military events of the Spanish Empire (from the wars of Charles V to the wars of Flanders, from the colonial campaigns in America to the thirty years war), often giving proof of great value and loyalty to the imperial authorities. The captains, belonging to the best feudal nobility of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces, were able to frame and prepare the subjects of the two viceroys for war, obeying the firm political direction given by the monarchs of Spain."

Carlo-the Partenope, and the four galleys S. Gennaro, Concezione, S. Antonio and Capitana , in addition to some minor wood. \nAt the same time the Marine Infantry Corps was established, the first in Italy designed to operate on board warships together with crews; later on his duties also included the supervision of naval bases. \nOur attempt to unite the Italian peninsula and creating a fleet to dominate the others seas should start with the creation of the largest navy the Mediterranean has ever seen."
