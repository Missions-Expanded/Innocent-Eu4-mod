 #Bijapur Missions
 bijapur_seperate_but_allies_title: "Connecting the Pieces"
 bijapur_seperate_but_allies_desc: "The various shattered parts of the once glorious Sultanate of Bahmanis are all fighting for power and the vultures to the north and south are striving for every inch of ground they can get in the Deccan. We need to be quick to make friends and allies with other powers if we are to secure Bijapur's safety for the coming few years; if we are stuck without any help at all, we will surely be destroyed without mercy."
 bijapur_shifting_markets_title: "The Bijapuri Rebound"
 bijapur_shifting_markets_desc: "The economy of Bijapur as a city unto itself took a substantial hit in revenue when we broke off from the declining Sultanate of Bahmanis, but our economy was not permanently cut down. By building new market districts and focusing our efforts on promoting the growth of our capital, we will be able to recover quickly and sufficiently."
 bijapur_sufi_connections_title: "The Sufis of Bijapur"
 bijapur_sufi_connections_desc: "Long have Sufis streamed into the Deccan from the various parts of Arabia and Persia. They have been a common part of various communities all the way from Multan to Delhi and even toward Bidar itself since sultans of various time periods needed them to help maintain order and slowly spread Islam whenever they could. We of Bijapur are no different in this respect and should strive to maintain religious harmony inside our own borders with the help of Sufis of various orders."
 bijapur_solidify_the_economy_title: "Markets & Mosques"
 bijapur_solidify_the_economy_desc: "The start of our economic rebound is set and we are well on the way to making sizable profits again, but we are not out of the woods yet. Administrators and military officials need a more steady revenue stream from multiple cities, not just Bijapur itself despite how good it is doing. Promoting growth through building mosques and new markets in surrounding areas will help accomplish this goal and help fund our growing state."
 bijapur_a_protected_capital_title: "The Bijapur Fort"
 bijapur_a_protected_capital_desc: "Whilst the markets of our capital are growing in greatly, we are left to wonder about how our capital will fare when roaming enemy armies come to try and capture it. Sure there are basic defensive structures in the city and at the edge of its perimeter, but leaving it without a proper fortress of some kind is simply too much of a risk. We can do more to protect our grand capital and help it grow in a more safe environment."
 bijapur_gol_gumbaz_and_jama_masjid_title: "Gol Gumbaz - Jama Masjid"
 bijapur_gol_gumbaz_and_jama_masjid_desc: "To honor those of our lineage and to honor Islam itself, we should be embarking on architectural plans for grand structures. Mausoleums and mosques are a basic concept indeed, but we of Bijapur have the capability and creativity to build more intricate and unique mausoleums and mosques complete with architecture and details that we want to see. The first of these great mausoleums shall be proclaimed as 'Gol Gumbaz', and the first of these great mosques shall be proclaimed as 'Jama Masjid', both of which will set us on a path of prestige and grandeur."
 bijapur_malik_i_maidan_cannon_title: "Master of the Field"
 bijapur_malik_i_maidan_cannon_desc: "The world continues to change slowly around us on the person-to-person level, but on the level of the military and the administration, things change at a fairly regular pace. Bijapur as a state cannot be sit idly by as things in warfare continue to evolve especially with gunpowder weapons both large and small being refined consistently. If we can amass enough cannons for our military and integrate them effectively into our strategies that we use on the field of battle, we'll become ever more masterful of how warfare is conducted."
 bijapur_prospects_in_golconda_title: "Guiding Golconda"
 bijapur_prospects_in_golconda_desc: "Perhaps the most abundant reason why Golconda is such a rich and prosperous place is because of the valuable diamonds and other gems taken out of the earth from its various mines. This prosperity was not only enough to bring Golconda to prominence, but it also brought forth the businesses of textile making, the refinement of metal ores, and also the trade in spices. Who are we of Bijapur to deny Golconda this prosperity? If Bijapur can be one economic hub of the Deccan, Golconda can be another!"
 bijapur_worthy_subjects_title: "Like Father Like Son"
 bijapur_worthy_subjects_desc: "We are very much like the child of the Sultanate of Bahmanis, and the Sultanate of Bahmanis was very much like its predecessor, the Delhi Sultanate: both of our predecessors made their mark on the land through gaining power through conquest, but that was not the only way they did so. Often times they held other states as a subject of the larger sultanate itself, exacting tribute and loyalty from subject rajas and princes so that they could more effectively project power. We of Bijapur are no exception in how we will need to project our power outward, so acquiring subject states should be something we get around to."
 bijapur_military_unison_title: "Standing Army Initiative"
 bijapur_military_unison_desc: "Though we are powerful and we have made our name known throughout the subcontinent, we are still lacking in a sufficiently centralized military system that has key facets like regulated payments, military academies, and distinct ranks for soldiers to ascend to. If we can instill enough discipline into our soldiers and bring forth the best military minds that Bijapur has to offer to the forefront, then we can initiate a centralization process that would culminate in a strong and effective standing army that all of Bijapur can depend upon."
 bijapur_quell_the_marathas_title: "Marathi Questions"
 bijapur_quell_the_marathas_desc: "The Marathi people are integral to Bijapur and all of the Deccan as a region. They have been around for as long as almost any other group on the subcontinent and though they may not hold as much power as they did in centuries past, they are still very influential on the local level in Bijapur. We need to win over their loyalty completely and ensure that their is very little in the way of rebellious sentiment among Marathi communities so that we can have a much more cohesive and prosperous homeland."
 bijapur_markets_and_workshops_title: "Prosperous Heights"
 bijapur_markets_and_workshops_desc: "Our great attention to economic matters and how our revenue is taken in has given Bijapur a new life of grandeur and grace, but our work is still not yet done. In cities surrounding Bijapur, such as Gulbarga, they lack the proper infrastructure and functional buildings that Bijapur does to make profits and produce materials and resources on the levels of Bijapur itself. Investing more money into adjacent cities and other places around our state will undoubtedly serve to enhance how much we bring in on not only a yearly basis, but a monthly basis as well."
 bijapur_education_and_grandeur_title: "Palmyra of the Deccan"
 bijapur_education_and_grandeur_desc: "With so much work being done to uphold Bijapur as the center of the Deccan, it is no wonder why artists, musicians, poets, and scholars all come to Bijapur from across the subcontinent and from beyond its shores. Our reputation is almost unmatched with how glorious our capital is and we should only be looking upward toward what else we can do to elevate it higher. The next step for us is to promote education throughout Bijapur whilst also retaining the prestige we've attracted over the decades, for universities and a lively court will certainly keep Bijapur at the forefront of the world."
 MARATHI_LOYALTY: "No owned provinces of Marathi culture has more than 2 unrest or 30% local autonomy."
 bijapur_utilize_the_raichur_doab_title: "Reconstruction in Raichur"
 bijapur_utilize_the_raichur_doab_desc: "The Raichur Doab is in need of attention after we have taken it over recently. It is home to plentiful fields that provide men and women with food as well other resources, but the recent wars in the Deccan have strained the region to its limit almost. Let us tend to these cities and fields carefully, promote construction efforts where they are needed, and see to it that we cement a strong foundation for Bijapur in these lands."


 #Deccani Missions
 bijapur_five_cities_five_successors_title: "Five Cities - Five States"
 bijapur_five_cities_five_successors_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Sultanate of Bahmanis, we have been left to struggle and fight for an existence that seems almost doomed at times. We are not alone in this though, as there are other cities in the former Deccani state that have gained prominence and power amidst the collapse.\nAhmednagar, Berar, Bijapur, and Golconda, all have aspirations for reuniting the lands of Bahmanis into one whole state and the city of Bidar itself is also trying to make itself a standing political figure still. We must not delay our conquest nor become stagnant in this quickly shifting political climate; we must steady ourselves and strike when the times are right so that our safety and power is secured."
 bijapur_the_battle_of_talikota_title: "Bulwark of the Deccan"
 bijapur_the_battle_of_talikota_desc: "The largest threat to us as of now is the Hindu powers to the south, most notably the Vijayanagara Empire. Though the power of the Sultanate of Bahmanis is but a memory now, with the consolidation of the five key cities of the Deccan under our authority we can effectively push back the Hindu encroachment from the south. The legacy of our predecessor will not be tarnished so easily!"
 bijapur_khandesh_and_vijayangara_title: "The Deccani Wars"
 bijapur_khandesh_and_vijayangara_desc: "There is much to be gained through conquering the Deccan and its lucrative cities, bountiful fields, and productive mines. We are not alone in seeing this, however, as those in the north and south are still willing to challenge our hegemony over the region as a whole. Let us draw our sword and meet these foes in battle for we will have to wage not just one single war to win over what is rightfully ours, but multiple wars that will dictate the very future of our empire and the fate of millions of people on the subcontinent."
 bijapur_unite_the_region_title: "Nizam-ul-Mulk"
 bijapur_unite_the_region_desc: "What it means to be a good Nizam (roughly meaning 'governor') and leader of the Deccan is hard to nail down. So many facets are required to be a competent administrator alone, but the challenges of the Deccan such as cultural clashes and religious confluences make it so that a truly benevolent and just Nizam-ul-Mulk (roughly meaning 'Governor of the Realm') will be hard to come by. We must never cease in our endeavor to make this happen though, since controlling the entirety of the Deccan will challenge our administration and its primary leadership time and time again. Truly we must look toward building a stable and prosperous future under a rightful Nizam."
 bijapur_chowmahalla_palace_title: "Chowmahalla Palace"
 bijapur_chowmahalla_palace_desc: "With our conquests throughout the Deccan complete and our military still embarking on conquests in neighboring regions, there are some within our dynasty and administration who think it would do us well to have a proper seat of residence. One of the most nominated candidate cities for this is near Golconda. Now, Golconda is prosperous and valuable of course, but the burgeoning city of Hyderabad nearby does not experience as many water shortages and as such would be a fitting place for a new palace of great detail and prestige. In time, as we plan out this new palace for our dynasty, we can formulate it into an administrative center of sorts, but that will only be in conjunction with it being the crowning achievement to our long line of conquests."

 bijapur_making_connections: "Making Connections"

 bijapur_cannons_ready: "Malik-i-Maidan, Master of the Field"
 desc_bijapur_cannons_ready: "We are learning the ways of the battlefield as it continues to evolve over the years.

 bijapur_market_profits: "The Bazaars of Bijapur"
 desc_bijapur_market_profits: "Our great spending on building up markets and workshops for our people and for foreign merchants is beginning to pay off. The revenue we are going to gain because of our investments will be nothing short of how much revenue was collected by ancient empires that like the Gupta or the Maurya."
 bijapur_new_varanasi_baghdad: "The Scholars and Schools of Bijapur"
 desc_bijapur_new_varanasi_baghdad: "The intent of our schools is to promote knowledge and literacy, as well as philisophical insight and scientific innovation. Though this will all come in time, the immediate effects of our efforts are being felt in how the Bijapur as an urban center is being shaped and developed."
 bijapur_blooming_of_education: "The Bijapuri Renaissance"
 desc_bijapur_blooming_of_education: "New thinkers are coming through our land and also being raised in our own schools and universities.
