 FRS_Timurid_Renaissance_title: "Timurid Renaissance"
 FRS_Timurid_Renaissance_desc: "Ever since the Timurid Conquest, the Persian Arts has been thriving under the patronage of the new suzerains. Unfortunately, most of the endeavour is based around the northern cities of Herat and Samarkand. It is time to begin disseminate the growth of arts in Farsistan."
 FRS_growth_of_farsi_coast_title: "Growth of Farsi Coast"
 FRS_growth_of_farsi_coast_desc: "In the days of yore, our Timurid branch has been ceded the region of Fars, and since that time, we have been ruling this area. The region has a massive potential, but it sees little to no actions done to exploit that wealth. This shall continue no more, for [Root.Monarch.GetName] understands the positives of letting his seigniory grow."
 FRS_align_with_ulugh_beg_title: "Align with Ulugh Beg"
 FRS_align_with_ulugh_beg_desc: "We are one amongst many other ambitious houses striving for power in the Persia. Of course, no man does all things by himself, and we ourselves ought to seek allies. Happily, there is a person that is the ideal ally for our ambitions. Our mutual cooperation shall lead to our greatness."
 FRS_the_fall_of_herat_title: "The Fall of Herat"
 FRS_the_fall_of_herat_desc: "The main Timurid line has been in decay for years. It is time to put the final nail in the coffin and seize the throne of Timur. The Farsi Timurids shall prevail."
 FRS_integrate_the_inheritance_title: "Integrate the Inheritance"
 FRS_integrate_the_inheritance_desc: "In the short-lasting power vacuum following the collapse of the Timurid Empire, we managed to snatch our own piece of the cake. The newly acquired territories have had our administration established in them and the only thing they lack is proper integration into the realm. They are plagued with separatists who wish to bring the territory back under the rule of the old branch and ones who wish to tear Fars from within."
 FRS_subjugate_baluchistan_title: "Subjugate Baluchistan"
 FRS_subjugate_baluchistan_desc: "The Baluchi Tribes are largely decentralized and weak under the rule of the local chiefs. Furthermore, their poor, yet important for trade land is crucial for our mercantile ventures. We must subjugate the tribesmen and divert the trade to the Farsi Cities."
 FRS_omani_treachery_title: "Omani Treachery"
 FRS_omani_treachery_desc: "Unfortunately, we are not the only ones to exploit the wonders of the Persian Gulf as on the other side lies the Omani Battleground, where other factions struggle for power. Their ports, while riddled with war, still pose a significant rivalry to the Farsi ports. Their influence must be eliminated."
 FRS_expand_our_domain_title: "Expand our Domain"
 FRS_expand_our_domain_desc: "Militaristic Expansion is one of the natural ways a country may grow. In the aftermath of the Timurids' Fall, we find ourselves surrounded by potential enemies and targets from all sides. In this environment we shall not tremble in fear, but we shall show our superiority in dominance by outward expansion."
 FRS_punish_ajam_title: "Punish Qom"
 FRS_punish_ajam_desc: "The foul Timurid branch of Qom is yet to fall under the weight of their misdeeds. Their fall must be swift, for Fars shall put justice into their own hands and punish Qom once and for all."
 FRS_the_persian_sword_title: "Fars - the Successor"
 FRS_the_persian_sword_desc: "Our rise to greatness was paved by the blood of our enemies. We shall not forsake our ideals and we shall fulfill our destiny - to establish a new dynasty, a Timurid one, or a Persian one, it is up for the history to decide."
 FRS_into_india_title: "Into India"
 FRS_into_india_desc: "With the Baluchistanis dealt with once for all and the Timurid Renaissance brought to [Root.Capital.GetName] it is time to set our sight elsewhere. The lands beyond the Indus are famed not only for their legacy of empires, but also for their wealth. That wealth shall not stay there, for it can be much better used in the Persian ports."
 FRS_indian_trade_title: "Grow the Gulf Trade"
 FRS_indian_trade_desc: "Trade is truly the Wealth of Nations and if we wish to exploit it, we must further expand our mercantile ventures into India. If we establish a constant flow of spice from India like the Arabians once did, we will be able to truly prosper and will be able to once again establish a powerful Persian Dynasty."
