 saxony_conquer_anhalt_and_lausitz_title: "A True Saxon State"
 saxony_conquer_anhalt_and_lausitz_desc: "While we hold the title of Saxony, and are therefore the nominal rulers of the Saxon people, the true saxon people occupy a vast swathe of German lands, much of which not just outside our own hands, but wthin the territories and fiefdoms of our sworn enemies. To be truly deserving of the title of Saxony, we must centralise the Saxon people under one nation. To precipitate this, we have created a grand plan. The first step, is to aquire the weak and defenseless lands of Anhalt to our north, while simultaneously striking eastwards into Bohemia. Too long have rightful god fearing Catholics laboured under the bootheels of those Hussite loving scum."
 saxony_conquer_neumark_and_mittelmark_title: "A United People"
 saxony_conquer_neumark_and_mittelmark_desc: "With our Victories over Bohemia, we are well on the way to being a proper Saxon state. There is no greater oppertunity than now to strike against our other greatest rival in Northern Germany. The Hohenzollerns of Brandenbug have long been a thorn in our sides, even worse is that the majority of their subjects are good Saxon people, while they themselves are of Swabian decent. Southerners cannot be trusted to hold the values and best interests of our people at heart. Liberate these lands, and give the Saxon people a proper home."
 saxony_conquer_northern_saxony_title: "A Finished Picture"
 saxony_conquer_northern_saxony_desc: "It is finally time. Our burning ambition has led us to unite almost every Saxon into our domain and now we sit upon the precipice of our ultimate goal. With but a few more battles, the Saxon people will finally be reunited for the first time since before the reign of Charlamagne oh so long ago."
 saxony_conquer_pommerania_title: "A Great Painting"
 saxony_conquer_pommerania_desc: "The plan was finished, all our goals had been acheived, and yet as [Root.Monarch.GetName] stared out from the Balcony of his grand vila, his mind dwelling on the many people who now inhabited his lands, he had an epiphany. It has been barely a year, and already the benefits of a united people shine through. Why is this prosperity restricted to merely ourselves? The Saxon people are not a selfish group, in fact, our crusade to unite our people was driven purely out of selfless reasons, to benefit the Saxon people over ourselves. We shall establish a colony in the northern states, a trial run. And should it succeed, we shall spread our unity to all of the German people."
 saxony_conquer_mecklenburg_title: "The Great Trade Port"
 saxony_conquer_mecklenburg_desc: "Our experiment has revealed much. The benefits of true German unification are now readily apparent, and the idea is now rapidly rippling through our populace, and taking hold of their minds. But it has also exposed a weakness in our methods. We have a severe lack of key resources, specifically fish and grain with which to feed our people, as well as metals to fuel our industry. While self sufficiency would be preferable, acquiring the trade port of Lubeck to the north and premiere access to the many goods that flow through it, would serve as a good stop gap measure until better solutions can be implemented."
 saxony_conquer_holstein_title: "Rebuke Danish Power"
 saxony_conquer_holstein_desc: "If we are truly set upon our task of unifying all Germans into a single state, then there is a transgression we cannot ignore. To the North, the lands of Holstein are proud Westphalian lands, a German people much like any other, and yet distinct enough to be worth preserving in our new order. And yet currently they languish under Danish control. It is our duty as Germans to rectify this horrific mistake, and use Danish blood to water the fields of Holstein."
 saxony_build_naval_buildings_title: "The Seas Beckon"
 saxony_build_naval_buildings_desc: "For a long time our nation has been landlocked, restrained by physical borders and barriers, while political and military rivals inhibited our state. And now these restraints have all been lifted from us. The Saxon People, joined by the Pomeranian and Westphalian brothers now under our banner, shall step out onto the seas, and in doing so, the whole world shall become open to us. But first we must have the ships, and infrastructure to support them."
 saxony_baltic_sea_fleet_title: "Wood and Iron"
 saxony_baltic_sea_fleet_desc: "Lumber and Nails. Two components that form the basis of any ship. With these two things we can construct vessels that can traverse any ocean. With but these two things, we shall construct a fleet that will surpass any other."
 saxony_high_navy_tradition_title: "New Traditions"
 saxony_high_navy_tradition_desc: "Our navy is young, and as such we are constantly learning new and valuable lessons. It would be best to record these, so that we may learn from them in the future, and through this we shall slowly develop a true navy, staffed by sailors more skilled than any other."
 saxony_conquer_brunswick_title: "A Threat to Our Unity"
 saxony_conquer_brunswick_desc: "While our steady unison of the Saxon people was done with good intentions, it has not gone unnoticed that we have claimed victory over the two nations that once served to keep our power in check. With Brandenburg and Bohemia both sent packing into the cold German night, other nations have risen against us, set on diving our nation up, and forever undoing all the work we have done in creating a proper Saxon state."
 saxony_conquer_lower_saxony_title: "Trade Flows From the West"
 saxony_conquer_lower_saxony_desc: "Let it be said that the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Rulers of Saxony do not listen to the wills and whims of their subjects. As news of strange lands and exotic goods come from the West, our people's interests have been peaked. Our current trade centres are poorly situated to aquiesce to such desires, and so we shall push towards the trade port of Hamburg. With its port onto the North sea, it is in a prime location to bring in all manner of Luxuries, freshly plundered from the New World."
 saxony_conquer_weser_area_title: "Westphalian Integration"
 saxony_conquer_weser_area_desc: "The people of Westphalia are a marvellous example of German culture. As Germans oursleves, we feel it is our mission to care for our brothers, and guide our Kin to a new and brighter tommorow, where the German people stand united against all threats. To truly call oursleves accepting of these people, we must have many of them in our nation. Having a major portion of our Population to be composed of Westphalians will vastly speed up the integration of these proud people into our Brotherhood."
 saxony_build_army_buildings_title: "Military Infrastructure"
 saxony_build_army_buildings_desc: "The soldiers of Saxony are enthusiasitic, and all are sworn to fight for us regardless of what may come. But they are but farmboys armed with old weapons. As of now we lack either the facilities to train these young soldiers, nor the manufactories to produce the weapons neccesary to supply them. It is our duty to these young heroes that we give them everything they might ask for. So that any death they suffer shall be a martyr's death, not a farmboys."
 saxony_build_artillery_units_title: "War has Changed"
 saxony_build_artillery_units_desc: "War has changed, the advent of cannons has called into question all previous military strategy. What use are castles when a single volley can bring down a wall, when even the walls of Constantinople can be torn down from afar and reduced to rubble in a heartbeat. If we are to escape irrelevance, we must adapt to these new ideas as quickly as possible. We shall turn our grand foundries to the production of these powerful culverins, and rain fire and death on those who threaten the German people."
 saxony_army_tradition_title: "Learn From Prussia"
 saxony_army_tradition_desc: "If there is a single people in Europe who have mastered the art of warfare, it is the Prussians. After their great crusades against the Baltic pagans of old, the Teutonic knights and their Prussian subjects have retained a highly disciplined force, and bred a thourough military methodology into the very blood of their people. And yet they remain German at heart. If we demonstrate to the Prussian people our dedication to those same principles, perhaps they will assist us in the future."
 saxony_major_hre_member_title: "An Imperial Ascendancy"
 saxony_major_hre_member_desc: "Our country is a great one. A home to brilliant minds who deserve respect far beyond what is paid to them. We must acquire a greater level of prestige within the Holy Roman Empire. We must prove our selves a viable nominee to the title of Emperor, and in doing so hopefully aquire the resources needed to reward the deserving already existing in our state."
 saxony_become_great_power_title: "Greatness Without Compare"
 saxony_become_great_power_desc: "It is done. We have acheived something never thought possible for a simple German state. We have risen from a duchy of Saxons in name alone, up to a state that sits comfortably around the same tables as the greatest nations of the world. This is it. Never again shall any nation be able to doubt our legitimacy, or our strength."
 saxony_support_reformation_title: "Embrace the Reformation"
 saxony_support_reformation_desc: "It has occured. Their is a cry rising throughout all of Europe. A cry of Reformation. The faithful are tired of being punished for their faith, simply because they will not bow before a far flung dictator, whose eyes have never once turned beyond the Italian Peninsula. No more shall that antichrist in messiah's clothing pass judgement from half the world away. This cry shall become our cry, a rallying call to all of Europe. We are here, we are Faithful and we are right."
 saxony_conquer_west_prussia_title: "Teutonic Tales"
 saxony_conquer_west_prussia_desc: "The Baltic region of Europe was one of the last holdouts of Paganism in all of Europe. For centuries the people of the region withstood conversion and any attempts to take over the reason by force, and for the longest time, the rest of the christian world were forced to admit the Balkan people, as an unpleasent blemish on christian europe, but one that could be ignored. In the end, it was the Teutonic Knights who finally pacified the region, sweeping through Prussia and the rest of the Baltics ensuring the extermination or conversion of all who opposed them. As an ascendant power, from a newly arisen religion, it would be symbloic for us to reenact this grand crusade, and much like the knights, our first port of call shall be Prussia."
 saxony_conquer_pomerelia_title: "The Gap Shall Be Widened"
 saxony_conquer_pomerelia_desc: "We have taken a defensible position within the Baltic region, but as of now logistical access to the region is difficult, a lack of roads and other such infrastructure between this new territory is partially responsible, but that will come with time. The real problem is the border with Poland. Any expedition between this new enclave and our homelands must carefully skirt the Polish border, and constantly be careful of not crossing the border and causing a diplomatic incident, while being ever vigilant for the groups of wandering bandits who flaunt the border, making their camps within Poland, and striking out against us for their profits. If we took a portion of the Polish land, and readjusted the borders to be more beneficial to our current arrangement, it would vastly improve our control of these new lands, and allow us to remove the banditry that infests the land just beyond the border."
 saxony_road_to_prussia_title: "A Protestant Crusade"
 saxony_road_to_prussia_desc: "We have properly established control of our portion of the Baltic, but as with the Teutonic Conquest before ours, the people of the region are stubborn and not prone to yielding to foreign authority. Small groups however, have approached us with various offers and deals, which could benefit us in the short run, though they would require us to make some dramatic political changes within our nation. After deliberation, the decision has been made to finish our conquest of the Prussian region, and then ensure that the terms of the deals, will be abided to by the entirity f he Prussian population. If so, it could be a golden oppertunity for us, and fulfill all of the obligations and mundanities necessary, to make the whole world acknowledge us, as the new @PRU §Y[PRU.GetName]§!."
 saxony_build_production_buildings_title: "A Land of Workmen"
 saxony_build_production_buildings_desc: "The Saxon people have always known the true value of hard work. With sufficient effort, anything can be accomplished, so long as the Saxon people work together. And yet the time of farmers and small town craftsmen is nearing its end. Industry is rapidly becoming more centralised, and the people of Saxony have yet to adapt to this change. If we invest in the construction of these workshops and manufactories, we may be able to demonstrate the viablility of these new methods, and in doing so, implore them to apply the same effort towards the work they do in our factories, as they once did in their fields."
 saxony_build_trade_buildings_title: "Support Internal Trade"
 saxony_build_trade_buildings_desc: "Trade has forever been known as a lucrative source of income for all nations around the mediterranean, and yet within the empire, the flow of Trade is tightly controlled, with powerful hegemons steering all manner of valuable goods into the security of their own vaults, leaving others with very little. While we have no way of changing this situation short of destroying those Hegemons, we can be more proactive. By promoting and supporting the local traders within our own nation, we can begin the circulation of the items produced in our many workshops, hopefully this will lead to the development of a proper trade structure within our nation. "
 saxony_strongest_trade_power_title: "Join the Hegemony"
 saxony_strongest_trade_power_desc: "Our rapidly developing Trade Network has not been ignored, traders from far and wide have slowly been turning to look at Saxony as they would Vienna and Krakow, as an important centre of trade. While before the Hegemons of the trading networks of the world were our enemies, now that we have caught their interests, they are becoming valuable allies, as it is their interest in our nation and the goods produced and circulated within it, that has spurred on the rapid implementation of efficient regulation and funded the rapid development of trading infrastructure."
 saxony_secure_position_in_the_hre_title: "Secure Our Station"
 saxony_secure_position_in_the_hre_desc: "Very few, if any, states within the HRE can be called truly secure in the HRE. Much like the Emperorship itself, the lands of the various states within the empire are almost enternally in flux. Maybe some are held stable for a small degree of time, but their fall is an inevitablity. By becoming sufficiently powerful, perhaps we could use our electorship as a lever to manipulate the emperor into announcing the lands of Saxony as a true Fief, so that it's division becomes almost impossible in the future."
 saxony_statue_in_restraint_of_appeals_title: "Statute in Restraint of Appeals"
 saxony_statue_in_restraint_of_appeals_desc: "Our lands lie in the North of Germany, far from the Italian peninsula, and yet over such a great distance, we are still expected to petition the pope for every matter of religious contention. Rome proclaims itself the final legal matter on all spiritual affairs, and yet their guidance never reaches as far as our lands. No longer. We shall turn away from Rome and it's uncaring leaders, and instead look to those who have shown time and again to believe in the good of the Saxon people, our rulers."
 saxony_develop_wittenberg_title: "Develop [59.GetName]"
 saxony_develop_wittenberg_desc: "A preacher has come to some renown recently in [59.GetName]. He has over some time compiled a list of the misdeads of the Catholic church, and a thesis on what is fundamentally wrong with it's methodology. All of this he nailed to the door of the local church. Naturally the contents of these theses have rapidly been distributed throughout the local area and beyond. After a brief read, many of the major players within our country have confirmed the validity of their contents, and now push us to show support for this radical reformer. While open support may not yet be a wise decision, if we invest in the local area, and while doing so, perhaps implement a few of these changes in the way the area is run, we may be able to show our favour without incuring political opposition."
 saxony_build_tax_buildings_title: "Taxation Regulations"
 saxony_build_tax_buildings_desc: "Appropriate Taxation is one of the most difficult tasks assigined to our bureaucracy, and yet they consitently get it wrong. It is clear that our administration simply cannot keep up with the rapid changes within our nation and therefore we have concocted a solution. The writings of Martin Luthor have created an oppertunity. Clerics and other theologians are often some of the most highly educated, and reforms on how they opperate are even now being demanded by the common people due to Luthor's Theses. If we were to consript clerics to assist us in the beaurecratic and administrative matters of their local areas, then perhaps they can rapidly become useful additions to our nation, instead of the spiritual and material leeches they are now."
 saxony_leader_of_protestant_union_title: "Union of Auhausen"
 saxony_leader_of_protestant_union_desc: "The tensions within the empire are reaching their peak, armed conflict across Germany is looking more and more innevitable. If the people of the reformation are to survive the coming storm, they must have a strong leader. There is no better nation to take on this position, and ensure the right of the reformed faiths to exist, than our own."
 saxony_winner_of_league_war_title: "Win the League War"
 saxony_winner_of_league_war_desc: "The storm has hit. The thunder is the sound of cannons, firing across the continent, toppling walls and tearing down fortifications. The rain is the hail of bullets and arrows, filling the air with shrieks and watering the ground with enough blood to water the plants for decades. The Wind is the cries and lamentations of the women and children left without their menfolk, to fend to themselves while their worlds burn to the ground. And dark clouds loom ever on the horizon, the threat of infidels and heathens from beyond the continent, all waiting for the perfect oppertunity to strike, and shatter Europe irreparably. This war must end. And it is our duty to our people to ensure it is in our victory."
 saxony_become_emperor_aow_title: "A Throne Built on Blood"
 saxony_become_emperor_aow_desc: "The imperial seat is now ours. A protestant emperor now reigns over all of Germany. But what was the cost? How many faithful died on the fields, so that we might sit atop this seat. How many people wil starve to death in the coming months because their are no men left to tend the fields, or because the fields themselves have been burned to the ground in the name of victory. It is our duty now to answer all of these questions, and provide a solution to each in turn. No embarrassment is too great, no humiliation not worth it so that our subjects might finally know peace, free from the persecution of the unenlightened. In my dreams, it is glorious. In my waking nightmares, everything is coated in blood."

 saxony_conquer_westphalia_and_north_rhine_title: "A New People"
 saxony_conquer_westphalia_and_north_rhine_desc: "Westphalian people have already been well integrated into our people, very little tension remains between the group and the other people who call our nation their home. It has come to our attention that Westphalian people under our rule now live better lives than those under the rule of leaders of primarily Westphalian leadership. As an united german state, with aims to bring equality and acceptance to all of the German peoples, we are simply in a much better position, politically, economically and militarily, than these smaller states, who are forced to exploit their own people just to remain stable. Let us free these people from their oppression and exploitation, and grant them the better lives we have already demonstrated are possible within our nation."
 saxony_conquer_hesse_and_franconia_title: "Franconian Submission"
 saxony_conquer_hesse_and_franconia_desc: "The Franconian people are a very small portion of the people of Germany. They remain under the reign of a very few leaders, and refuse the rule of anyone not of Franconian descent. If we are to create a united German state, as is our ultimate goal, then we need to reach a compromise with these people that would allow us to properly integrate these people into our nation without the use of overly forcible methods. A people whose freedom is taken will always rise against their rulers at every oppertunity. A People who offer up their independance willingly will be much more ready to find their own place within a larger system."
 saxony_conquer_erzgebirge_and_lower_bavaria_title: "Bavaria In Bloom"
 saxony_conquer_erzgebirge_and_lower_bavaria_desc: "Bavaria is a land who have treasured their independance and special responsibilities within the Empire. They are a powerful state within the Empire, who have always been able to keep pace with all the states around them, despite the more advantageous positions of those neighbouring rivals. It is a certainty that such adaptable people would find a great home within our fledgling German state, and that we have plenty of benefits that could come from them."
 saxony_conquer_upper_bavaria_title: "Austrian Resistance"
 saxony_conquer_upper_bavaria_desc: "Austria is the seat of the Von Habsburg dynasty, a dynasty of such power and prestige that they have been able to consistently aquire the Imperial Seat due to their ability to manipulate the Kings and lower Lords of other lands to be their own purposes, and a well arranged system of political marriages that allow them to place their own dynasty on other thrones cross the catholic world. And now they have turned all of that power against us. The Austrians stand as the final opposition within the Empire that still retains the ability to challenge us. We are now locked in a race with them for the remaining Bavarian lands and to cut each other off from the Swabian and Swiss lands."
 saxony_be_hre_elector_title: "A Grand Electorate"
 saxony_be_hre_elector_desc: "There are very few positions within the Holy Roman Emperor more prestigious and powerful than that of an Elector. Granted to them is the supreme authority with which to crown the Emperor of the faithful, the leader of the Most Holy empire on the planet. If we were to secure such a position, then no door within the empire would be closed to us."
 saxony_become_kingdom_title: "A Kingdom Within"
 saxony_become_kingdom_desc: "The title of King within the Empire is one of extreme prestige and is an incredible show faith from the Emperor. Only the Emperor himself may grant unto a catholic state within the empire the right to call itself a Kingdom, and once granted such a title may never be revoked. If we were able to aquire such a title, then no one in the Empire would be able to question our legitimacy as a true soverign state."
 saxony_polish_claims_title: "A Saxon Poland"
 saxony_polish_claims_desc: "The Elective Monarchy of Poland is a marvellous concept. It allows the potential for the best possible ruler to rule the nation, while also securing foreign alliances. However it has one major failling. It has no legislative protection from the whims of the nobles that form the electors. As a rising power on their borders, many of the Polish Nobles holding lands along our border have subtley approached us to discuss matters of protection. With these votes, and a few more we may gain from diplomacy and bribes within the nation, it may be possible for us to turn the Polish Crown over to a member of our dynasty, and then, with the support of the border nobles, overturn the elective monarchy, leaving us the absolute rulers of Poland and Saxony."
 saxony_polish_union_title: "The Polish Prerogative"
 saxony_polish_union_desc: "Poland is now our subject, but their loyalty is yet to be won. The nobility on the borders with our direct holdings are all for the complete integration of Poland into our nation, subverted with promises of higher titles and the destruction or demotion of their rivals. Now is a time to allow the status quo to dvelop, and allow the opposing nobles to stabilise and acclimatise to their new positions, and perhaps, in time, they will realise that becoming part of Saxony, is a much better turn of events then they first realised."
 saxony_integrate_poland_title: "Integrate Poland"
 saxony_integrate_poland_desc: "The time has come. With our skilled manipulation of the nobility within Poland, playing them off against each other, inflaming conflicts and supplying backdoor deals and equipment to nobles believed to weak to intervene in the situation. At last the Polish nobility is depleted. The few remaining lynchpins within the country are all staunchly devoted to the idea of becoming powerful nobles within a much greater nation, and the remainder are too weak to oppose them. Now is finally the time to cease the existance of Poland as an subordinate nation to our own, and instead let the Province of Poland come to exist the great nation of Saxony."
 saxony_have_center_of_reformation_title: "A Religious Centre"
 saxony_have_center_of_reformation_desc: "With the advent of the reformation and the rapid conversion that is occuring with the populace of northern Germany, it is becoming more and more apparent that we are simply not equipped to prevent this amound our own populace, but neither would we want to. The reformation is yet another way that we may demonstrate the superiority to the southern powers, and what better way to show our demonstrate our dedication to this new path then to officially establish a centre of reformation within our nation, from which the reformed doctrine can be spread and the populace educated."
 saxony_become_defender_of_faith_title: "In Defense of Our Faith"
 saxony_become_defender_of_faith_desc: "Despite the grand popularity of the reformed faiths within Europe, none of the powerful nations of the continent are willing to place their own necks on the line in defense of such fledgling beliefs. Their shall be no Protestant Crusades, no Anglican shall cry Deus Vult as he storms the walls of Jerusalem, but their are other ways of demonstrating faith. by making a public, world wide announcement of our intentions to defend all reformed people from persecution, we will turn the eyes of Europe towards us, where they should be."

 saxony_conquer_palatinate_and_lower_rhine_land_desc: "The Duchy of the Palatinate and the surrounding lands of the Rhine are home to the Rhenish people, a proud German people whose lands are some of the most developed and advanced witihin the entire Holy Roman Empire. With them added to our own lands and properly integrated, they would be a great addition to our patrimony, providing obvious proof of the benefits of diversity, as the economic and technological benefits of their people, are combined with the security and effective government of our own."

 saxony_conquer_lower_swabia_and_upper_rhineland_desc: "Swabia is the final truly German people that remains outside of our rule. The Austrians have dihluted their culture with that of Italians and Hungarians, interbreeding until they are more mongrel that German. The Swiss care not for the rest of Europe, let alone the rest of Germany, they would resist until the end of time, and such would prevent us from turning our gaze elsewhere, to lands where our attention is more needed. And the Dutch care more for the ocean than the people, they flee to the waves as a way to escape the problems of Germany and Europe, and use narcotics and other forest plants to escape to the prisons of their own minds. The Swabians are the end of everything."

 saxony_road_to_germany_desc: "@GER §Y[GER.GetName]§! is on the Horizon. Our grand ambition is one of such scope that it seemed impossible to acheive from the first day, but our people pushed forwards regardless, perhaps naively, but with an optimism and drive that put to shame the entire world. Now we stand on the very precipice, only a single province remains outside our domain, and with it's acquisition we could legitimately identify ourselves as not Saxony, but Germany. Let the world know of the unity of the German people, let them hear the roar of a people who will no longer be divided, who will no longer allow foreign aggressors to turn them against each other and will instead stand taller than any other nation in the world."
