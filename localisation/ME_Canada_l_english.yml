 ME_Canada_Events.80.D: "It was late at night, all but the drunkards around the fire were fast asleep within each other's respective tents, there was light rain - even that wasn't enough to put the drunkards to bed. From within the tents, many close to the campfire could hear clear as day an escalating situation outside. Two of the drunken members had decided to let anger get the better of them, starting from verbal insults to each other to the sounds of a person or two getting hit, to sounds of swords clashing.  This was until many heard the Captain yell to the erratic men to disperse and head to bed or face punishment. Within seconds two gunshots were heard, waking the entire camp, upon leaving the tent, many were surrounding a man on the ground...a flintlock in hand, and with a wound with a through the heart, It was the captain, and he was dead."

"
 ME_Canada_Events.84.OPT1: "At least it wasn't poisonous."
 ME_Canada_Events.84.OPT2: "Maybe we should grow more and start a business?"

 ME_Canada_Events.85.T: "Devious Fruits"
