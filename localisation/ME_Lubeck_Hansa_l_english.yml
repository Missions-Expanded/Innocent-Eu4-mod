 lbk_construct_gate_title: "Construct Burgtor"
 lbk_construct_gate_desc: "The city of Lübeck sits is rich and yet so very vulnerable. While we have no deigns on constructing grand fortresses, surely it can't hurt to erect some minor defenses to ward off greedy armies."
 
 lbk_construct_gate_2_title: "Construct Holstentor"
 lbk_construct_gate_2_desc: "Perhaps we should upgrade the gates again? This time, something a bit stronger?"
 
 lbk_asserted_power_title: "Assert Power"
 lbk_asserted_power_desc: "As leader of the premier trade organization in Europe, it would be a blight our name to only exhibit a paltry share of trade in the Baltic."
 
 end_sound_toll_ME_title: "End The Sound Toll"

 lbk_london_title: "Create English Kontor"
 lbk_london_desc: "The Kontor model has proved to be both lucrative and sustainable in Peterhof and Bergen. Establishing a Kontor presence in the English Channel is the next logical step up to improving our trade networks, and London the the perfect place. The question remains, how shall we approach this; naming a price, or perhaps demands under duress...?"
 
 lbk_bergen_title: "Elevate Bergen"

 lbk_expand_legaue_title: "Expand the Hansa"
 lbk_expand_legaue_desc: "The expansion of the Hansa to include more members and even establishing independent trade cities is a reward in its own. It could be more than just that, though."

 lbk_france_desc: "The French are a major power to the west, distinguished in that they have very few, if any, reasons to compete with our own foreign interests. A diplomatic mission to hammer out a non-aggression pack would be mutually beneficial for both of us."
 
 lbk_project_embargo_title: "Embargo Our Rivals"

 lbk_iberia_title: "Purchase Spanish Kontor"

 lbk_france_trade_title: "Negotiate French Trade"
 lbk_france_trade_desc: "Our longstanding agreement with the French have warmed them our diplomatic charms. Negotiating a trade agreement with them, we say, will bring wealth into both of our horizons."

 lbk_french_trade_agreement_tooltip: "France gain §YFrench-Hanseatic Trade Agreement§! (Trade Power: §R-0.5§!) §Yper each French province§! until 2 January, 1821\nThe Hansa gain §YFrench-Hanseatic Trade Agreement§! (Trade Power: §G-0.5§!) §Yper eacg French province§! until 2 January, 1821"
 
 lbk_annex_title: "Invite the Members"
 lbk_annex_desc: "The Hansa started long ago as a loosely organized trade league, created to maximize fortune and wealth in the North. It has since grown and evolved to much more: the Confederation. Though we are not yet one, we can still stand united."

 #events
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.t: "Elevating Bergen Kontor"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.d: "First Established as a Hanseatic center in 1350, Bergen has since grown into a fully fleged trade post, featuring wharfs, shopfronts, and all manner of warehouses. The location provides the League a strategic position to access the North Sea and White Sea markets; perhaps we should capitalize on this?"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.a: "Money is no issue!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.b: "A risky investment..."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.c: "I'd rather not."
    
 ME_Lubeck_Events.2.t: "Hanseatic Investments"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.2.d: "The Hanseatic league has decided to invest some money to improving the trading infrastructure of Bergen. This may not quite be the blessing it sounds to be..."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.2.a: "That could cut into our profits..."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.2.b: "Maybe it won't be too bad."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.3.t: "Purchase of Steelyard"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.3.d: "English-Hanseatic relations have been fraught with conflict in recent years; English merchants and Hanseatic Merchants alike have shown their fair share of competition, especially amongst the lucrative wool and cloth trade. The tides seem to be turning, however, as recent events have weakened the English. We may finally be able to establish a foothold in the Isles, right in London itself!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.3.a: "Excellent!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.3.b: "We can't quite afford that."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.4.t: "Purchase of Steelyard"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.4.d: "Those crafty merchants have made us an offer we can't refuse..."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.4.a: "I'm not sure this is the best deal..."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.5.t: "Seizure of Hanseatic Assets"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.5.d: ""
 ME_Lubeck_Events.5.a: ""
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.6.t: "Renewal of the Novgorod Charter"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.6.d: "Peterhof was organized between us and the Novgorodians as a port for Hanseatic trade in the Eastern Baltic and subsequently Russia. Political developments have placed our agreement on shaky ground however it should be possible to organize safe passage for out merchants if we "invest" a little money into the kontor..."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.6.a: "Invest straight into their pockets, eh?"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.6.b: "No funds for that now."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.7.t: "Novgorod Kontor Renewed"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.7.d: "The merchants of the Hansa have elected to renew their trade agreement for their outpost in Novgorod; surely this won't cut too deep into our pockets."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.7.a: "I see."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.8.t: "Restoration of Antwerp Kontor"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.8.d: "The Antwerp Kontor is a newer Kontor and yet it has quickly fallen into disrepair from negligence. Surely a few ducats will be well worth the investment in improving our stake in the English Channel?"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.8.a: "Do it!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.8.b: "Not this time."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.9.t: "Restoration of Antwerp Kontor"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.9.d: "The Hanseatic merchants have shown interest once again in their trade posts in Antwerp. They have sent many ships through the location and we ave heard word of reinvigorating the Hanzekantoor."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.9.a: "Ha! Maybe it won't be a waste this time."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.10.t: "Establishing the Iberia Kontor"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.10.d: "Hanseatic investiture has stretched it tentacles far and wide across Northern Europe, but it is now time to look East and South, particularly into the Iberian peninsula. A small foothold here will be a key point in establishing a presence in the lucrative and rich Mediterranean Sea."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.10.a: "I can already here the ducats!"
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.11.t: "Leasing Santander"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.11.d: "Hanseatic Merchants have come to negotiate the purchase of a trade post in one of our cities. They tell us of the great wealth and trade opportunities they could bring us and express that it is a mutually beneficial agreement."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.11.a: "Smooth talkers, those merchants..."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.12.t: "Create the Portuguese Kontor"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.12.d: "With a kontor in Spain proper, we have only one more location to look to before Mediterranean proper: Portugal. Portugal has a massive global trade presence and surely would not mind a small trade post in Lisbon!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.12.a: "Ah ha!"
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.13.t: "Bairro Alemão"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.13.d: "Hanseatic Merchants have come to negotiate the purchase of some land in our capital city for the use of a trade port, or a kontor, as they call it. Should we or should we not?"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.13.a: "It's an offer we can't refuse..."
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.14.t: "Invitation to the Confederation"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.14.d: "The centralization of the Hanseatic League has approached that of a loosely strung together state. Their power and influence have made us an attractive subject to join as smaller trade cities flock to integrate into the Confederacy in hopes that the wealth will flow to them as well. And now, it is our time to decide!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.14.a: "What's the worse that could happen?"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.14.b: "We are better off on our own..."
 lbk_invitation_tooltip: "Every Trade League Member whose opinion of §YThe Hansa§! is at least §Y200§! will cede their provinces to the Hansa.\n\n"
 
 ME_Lubeck_Events.15.t: "Trade Policies in India"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.15.d: "The Indies have proven to be a veritable cornucopia of valuable products and ducats! We must be wary, however of the overextension that may result in our attempts to maintain a presence on this foreign continent. Veteran merchants and advisors have suggested formalizing articles to cede the responsibilities to private enterprise, while others have encouraged the use of state-sponsored merchants."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.15.a: "No need to micromanage!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.15.b: "We'll handle it from here."

 ME_Lubeck_Events.16.t: "Mare Nostrum"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.16.d: "The Mediterranean was once called Mare Nostrum by the Romans, and has remained a nickname for the major powers of the region. Who would have ever guessed that we would end up doing the same? Regardless, it appears our domination of the Mediterranean has raised some debate amongst our merchants on the things we should promote. Food, wine, or art?"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.16.a: "Promote Grain Exports!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.16.b: "Promote Wine Exports!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.16.c: "Recruit the Artisans!"
