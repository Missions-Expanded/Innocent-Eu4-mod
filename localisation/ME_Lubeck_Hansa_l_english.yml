 HNS_rival_the_queen_title: "Rival the Queen"
 HNS_rival_the_queen_desc: "Lübeck bears the nickname of the Queen of the Hanseatic League. Indeed, it is true that the city has received more than enough attention from all merchants alike. Let us seize that spot from them and become the new hotspot for merchants and traders around."

 HNS_our_roots_title: "Our Roots"
 HNS_our_roots_desc: ""
 HNS_restore_trade_links_desc: "Once sprawling and lively trade routes have fallen into negligence and disrepair due to the Hanseatic decline. As our league is reliving its glory days, there is a chance at restoring them."

 HNS_interests_in_the_baltic_desc: "The Baltic 'Eastern Lake' makes up for like a half of our trade routes. We need to wage our decisions carefully,  else our grip over the region might slip out of our hands."
 HNS_mother_of_all_trade_title: "Mother of All Trade"
 HNS_mother_of_all_trade_desc: "Danzig is one of the most important hanseatic cities. Why is that? It's simple. It is the primary hotspot for the Grain trade - Mother of all Trades.

 HNS_peterhof_title: "Grow Peterhof"
 HNS_peterhof_desc: "Peterhof was organized between us and the Novgorodians as a port for Hanseatic trade in the Eastern Baltic and subsequently Russia.

 HNS_interests_in_the_north_sea_title: "Das Deutsche Meer"
 HNS_interests_in_the_north_sea_desc: "The North Sea is more plentiful in rivals to our League, but no rival cannot be our friend. It is thanks to the policy that other merchants can be our partners, that the Hansa has grown so prevalent in the western sea."
 HNS_dutch_kontor_title: "The Entrepot of Cloth"
 HNS_dutch_kontor_desc: "If there is something the Flemish have plentiful of, it is weavers. Who would have guessed that shipping wool from England to Flanders and cloth from Flanders to England would be so simple, yet so profitable."
 HNS_elevate_bergen_title: "Elevate Bergen"

 HNS_london_steelyard_title: "Carta Mercatoria"
 HNS_london_steelyard_desc: ""The Kontor model has proved to be both lucrative and sustainable in Peterhof and Bergen. Establishing a Kontor presence in the English Channel is the next logical step up to improving our trade networks, and London the the perfect place. The question remains, how shall we approach this; naming a price, or perhaps demands under duress...?""
 HNS_antwerpen_title: "Reinforce Antwerpen"
 HNS_antwerpen_desc: "The Hanzekantoor in Antwerp has fallen into disrepair. It's nothing a few ducats can't fix. Let us pour our ducats into this lucrative trade route."
 HNS_trading_empire_title: "Under the Pennant"
 HNS_trading_empire_desc: "White on top, red on the bottom. That are the colors of the Hanseatic pennant. If one sees those colors on a cog, it is no secret that the Hanseatic merchants are there for business. After all, it is in trade that we find solace."
 HNS_economic_might_title: "Concordia Domi"

 HNS_combat_the_decline_title: "Combat the Decline"
 HNS_combat_the_decline_desc: "The Hansa is in decline. Has been for a while. We have effectively amortized this trend, but the rise of Colonial Empires threatens our business. Unless we follow suit, our golden age is over."

 HNS_fight_for_baltic_dominance_desc: "There is a war going on in the Baltic Sea right now. Though silent, it is bound to burst into an open conflict. It is a conflict of interests between the Kalmar Union and the Hansa. Who will rule the seas? We will."
 HNS_free_the_sound_title: "Free the Sound"
 HNS_free_the_sound_desc: "Enough is enough. Controlling two pieces of land by sea divided should not imply control over the trade that passes between and through them.

 HNS_defeat_the_danish_title: "Hegemony in Scandinavia"
 HNS_defeat_the_danish_desc: "The Danish have been trying to question our economic hegemony for a while. Time to strike a decisive blow and show that there is nothing as 'questioning Hanseatic authority.'"

 HNS_krantor_desc: "Let us construct a grand Krantor, much like the one in Danzig, that can serve all of our common merchant needs. After all, we are more of a community than an organization."
 HNS_dudesche_arsenal_title: "Arsenal der Hansa"
 HNS_dudesche_arsenal_desc: "Let us construct an arsenal worthy of our League. One that will not just serve as a deterrent, but as a real core of our maritime empire."
 HNS_mercenary_core_title: "A Mercenary Core"
 HNS_mercenary_core_desc: "Unsurprisingly, a Confederation of cities needs not rely on conscripts to fight their wars. Why force people to fight our wars when we can simply hire war-hardened mercenaries?"
 HNS_all_trade_title: "Merchants with a State"

 HNS_high_seas_navy_desc: "The symbol of the Hansa may be the cog, but cogs is not what we may sail the high seas with. In order to build a robust trade network with in America, our shipping needs protection."
 HNS_newfoundland_title: "Newfoundland Fisheries"
 HNS_newfoundland_desc: "Not much is known about the American continent, but out of the things that we do know is that it is an unexploited land whose trade networks are beginning to grow which will dictate the great powers of future. One part of the continent in general - Newfoundland - has already gained fame for its fishing grounds which threaten our monopoly over the Scandinavian herring. That trade must be controlled by us."
 HNS_america_title: "American Imports"
 HNS_america_desc: "Among the trade routes newly founded by the explorers in Age of Exploration is the trade with the quite mysterious continent of America. While those lands are still shrouded in mystery, the wealth of it is known as far as [Root.Capital.GetName] and beyond."

 HNS_monopolize_imports_desc: "In the days of yore, Hansa used to rule all trade in the Northern Europe. These times are, of course, over, but it does not mean we cannot at least attempt to restore the great monopoly of old. The most important task of ours is to adapt, and adapt we must to the new routes that have been shaped by the Age of Discovery. The maritime route to India and the East Indies allows for the lucrative Spice Trade, which is far from our control. Having acquired ports in India, it is time we control the East Indies and bring the Spice where it belongs - [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 HNS_india_title: "Indische Kompanie"
 HNS_india_desc: "Who has not heard of India? This famed land is rich in Gold, Gems and Spices. And it is true that while we have the Gold and Gems here, it is not right however that we have control over the Spice Trade. We need to found new Kontors in India and monopolize the subcontinent's trade for our own benefit."
 HNS_eternal_diet_title: "Eternal Diet"
 HNS_eternal_diet_desc: "Hansetage (Hanseatic Days) were meetings held by the representatives of the Hanseatic Leagues' members. Those were usually held in Lubeck, due to its central position, but could also be held in other Hanseatic cities, prime or not. The meetings were called whenever needed. Unfortunately though, the turnout was quite low, which was the leading cause for many issues. Never was there more than half of the cities' representatives on a single meeting, despite the sanctions that were placed on insubordinate cities. Despite that, it is time we reform this institution and make it into a permanent body of our confederation."
 HNS_grow_the_markets_title: "Grow the Markets"

 HNS_fortify_the_cities_desc: "With the multitude of the Leagues' member cities and the exclaves they possess, we are in control of an uncountable amount of outposts that need to be defended. As such it is most imperative that we invest our funds into something that is necessary for the thriving art of trade - safety and peace."
 HNS_hanseatic_cog_title: "The Cog"
 HNS_hanseatic_cog_desc: "Cog is the ship that is the most associated with our League and the trade practiced by us. We shall cherish and perfect the design of this wonderful vessel, and let it drift gracefully across the serene northern seas. Cog was, is, and shall remain the symbol of our powerful confederation."
 HNS_french_perpetual_peace_title: "French Perpetual Peace"
 HNS_french_perpetual_peace_desc: "The French are a major power to the west, distinguished in that they have very few, if any, reasons to compete with our own foreign interests. A diplomatic mission to hammer out a non-aggression pack would be mutually beneficial for both of us."
 HNS_establish_new_kontors_title: "Establish New Kontors"
 HNS_establish_new_kontors_desc: "With our newly established diplomatic relations with the kings and dukes in France we will construct a brand new network of trade routes that will reach even further than the bustling streets of Londoner Steelhof.

 HNS_old_salt_road_title: "Old Salt Road"
 HNS_old_salt_road_desc: "One of the trade routes that allowed Lubeck, and consequently, the Hansa, to grow as powerful as the history teaches us, was the Old Salt Route, allowing for the maritime republic's trade for salt. As regards the salt, it was the primary resource that allowed for longtime conservation of food, allowing for the trade and transport of meat, and especially fish."

 HSA_grow_the_league_title: "Grow the League"
 HSA_grow_the_league_desc: "The expansion of the Hansa to include more members and even establishing independent trade cities is a reward in its own. It could be more than just that, though."
 HSA_contact_inner_cities_title: "Contact Inner Cities"

 ME_Hansa_Events.4.b: "Reinforce the Scanian Markets."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.5.t: "Hanseatic Merchants in America"
 ME_Hansa_Events.5.d: "With the age of discovery well underway, even the Hanseatic Merchants made their way to the Americas. The europe-famous Hanseatic Cog now brings goods between the various North American Harbors, which are eventually transported by our heavy ships to Europe."

 ME_Hansa_Events.7.d: "Should we send our mercenaries and take over key cities? If we do, we will be able to hold much more control over the trade routes, but we might alienate all of our partners in the mean time. Who wants to trade with a warmonger?"
 ME_Hansa_Events.7.a: "Seize the Kontors."
 ME_Hansa_Events.7.b: "By peace is how we make business."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.8.t: "Decline of the Hansa"
 ME_Hansa_Events.8.d: "Due to the rise of Colonial Empires, the control over the northern trade has been slipping from our hands.

 ME_Hansa_Events.10.d: "We have taken over [Root.GetName], one of our key outposts. Thanks to such, we will be able to exert much more control over the various trade links between our cities and such. Furthermore, thanks to our actions, the city will forever be tied with us."
 ME_Hansa_Events.10.a: "Alright."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.11.t: "[Root.GetName] Secedes from the League"
 ME_Hansa_Events.11.d: "[Root.GetName] has decided to cut ties with its former trade partners, and to seek to forge a future for themselves. What their future will be is left to be decided."

 ME_Hansa_Events.12.t: "Emergence of a New League"

 ME_Hansa_Events.13.d: "[From.GetName] has been growing quite a bit, up to a point they are second to us in power and influence and are bound to outgrow us. Recently, they have made moves to take control over the league. We cannot just let them do this, can we?"

Those were usually held in Lubeck, due to its central position, but could also be held in other Hanseatic cities, prime or not. The meetings were called whenever needed. Unfortunately though, the turnout was quite low, which was the leading cause for many issues. Never was there more than half of the cities' representatives on a single meeting, despite the sanctions that were placed on insubordinate cities. Despite that, it is time we reform this institution and make it into a permanent body of our confederation."
