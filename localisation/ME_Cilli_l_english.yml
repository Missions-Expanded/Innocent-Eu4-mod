 cli_renew_celje_castle_title: "Renew Celje Castle"
 cli_renew_celje_castle_desc: "The castle at Celje has is an important strategic center for the counts of Celje. The dynasty which was once know as Žovneski have  inherited the castle after the death of the Vovbrski dynasty in the 14th century. Celje castle soon became the new seat of the Žovneski and they soon started to call themselves as Celjski after their newly acquired castle. We should improve the castles defenses and enlarge it so that it might prove a worthy home for the small yet ambitious Celjski dynasty."
 cli_develop_slovenia_title: "Develop Slovenia"
 cli_develop_slovenia_desc: "The counts of Celje had at different times small possessions throughout the western Balkans. But the core of their power was allways in the lands of modern day Slovenia. This geographically diverse region features different terrains such as mountains in the North, fertile farmlands in the east, Limestone rich Karst in the south and a small coastline in the west. In the center lie hills upon hills covered with immense forests and thousands of streams. We have been blessed by lands rich in natural resources and the beauty of our countryside rivals that of Italy and France. We must not let all this natural potential go to waste. It is time we modernize our agricculture, expand our farms, improve our infrastructure and connect our many seperated possessions. The lands of the Slovenes shall be prosperous."
 cli_generic_trade_missions_title: "Entrepot of Cilli"
 cli_generic_trade_missions_desc: "The city of Celje is as important as the castle guarding it. Its location on the Savinja river, which then flows into the Sava means that a complex river trade network could be established all across Štajerska and Kranjska. The fertile soil around Celje and the nearby town of Lasko is also known for its hopp production. We should invest in expanding the main market of Celje and capitalize on local beer production."
 cli_nourish_adriatic_trade_title: "Nourish Adriatic Trade"
 cli_nourish_adriatic_trade_desc: "After gaining access to the sea it is time we build a large merchant fleet to help us dominate Adriatic trade."
 cli_consolidate_crown_title: "Consolidate the Crown"
 cli_consolidate_crown_desc: "We might have full support by the slavic peasentry, but to be safe from any pretenders or civil war we must strive to appease the catholic clergy, rich burgers and the powerful nobility of Celje."
 cli_slovene_asbolutism_title: "Slovene Absolutism"
 cli_slovene_asbolutism_desc: "It has often been said, by Slovenians themselves that they are a people who are willing to serve whoever treats them well. After being ruled over by Italians, Hungarians and Austrians for centuries it seemed that the hand might change but the whip stays. No longer should others abuse the nearly naive kindness and hard work of the Slovenian people. The rulers of Celje shall not over them but for them, with an absolute power regardless if the foreign nobles agree or not."

 cli_control_croatia_title: "Control Croatia"
 cli_control_croatia_desc: "Ruling over a small slavic country in the middle of a germanic empire has its benefits. It makes it easier to reach across to the outher southern slavs that border the Holy Roman Empire. The Croats who are suffering below Hungarian rule are longing to unite with our Slovene subjects. With a smart dynastic foreign policy we have already managed to gain possessions in Slavonia and Croatia. It is time we fully seize the lands around Zagreb, Varaždin, Trsat and Kostanjica. Ulrik II. has been appointed to prepare the Hungarian nobility to accept Ladislau von Habsburg as their new ruler. Should Ladislau die young or the Hunyadis take over, Croatian castles could be used a base from which to wage war for the Hungarian crown."
 cli_secure_dalmatia_title: "Secure Dalmatia"
 cli_secure_dalmatia_desc: "After taking Croatia and Slavonia the only Croatian lands not yet in our possession is Dalmatia. The eastern Adriatic cities are governed by the Venetians and they control most of the trade flowing from the Mediterranean into the western Balkans. By seizing Dalmatia for ourselfs we would profit immensely from overseas trade. A large coastline on the Adriatic will also serve as our window to the World."
 cli_bohemian_ties_title: "Bohemian Ties"
 cli_bohemian_ties_desc: "The Celjski dynasty would have been a mere footnote in the chronicles of history were it not for the Bohemians. The day that Herman II Celjski saved the life of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund von Luxembourg drastically changed the destiny of this unknown dynasty. Ever since the battle of Nicopolis in 1396 the rulers of Bohemia and the rulers of Celje enjoyed very friendly relations, going as far as lifting the rulers of Celje to imperial princes and Sigismund marrying Hermans daughter Barbara, making her queen of Bohemia and Hungary, as well as empress of the Holy Roman Empire. Fate was not kind to the von Luxembourgs and they were eventually replaced by others as rulers of Bohemia. We should re establish close relations with the kingdom of Bohemia. God works in mysterious ways and another miracle might happen, bringing our two realms even closer."

 #3
 cli_hand_cards_title: "A Hand of Cards"
 cli_hand_cards_desc: "The great game of European diplomacy is all but familiar to the House of Cilli. Having married and interacted with the great houses of Luxembourg, Habsburg, and Anjou has made us adept in all matters of diplomacy. Although recently having been denied our rightful claim to Bosnia, we still have many ties across Europe. Our hand of cards lies ready, all we have to do is make a move."
 cli_hungarian_regency_title: "Hungarian Regency"
 cli_hungarian_regency_desc: "Hungary lies in ruins after civil wars, Ottoman raids and wars waged for St. Stephans crown. The rulers of Celje finally emerged as the winners and after a lot of bloodshed combined with good diplomacy they now rule over all of Hungary. It is time we bring peace to these lands and prepare for its defense against the Turkish beast."
 cli_hunyadi_threat_title: "The Hunyadi Threat"
 cli_hunyadi_threat_desc: "Ruling over Hungary is a difficult task. Supporters of the Hunyadi have continued their rebellion for a long time. But our prestige and fair rulership over their lands has finally appeased the Hungarian nobility, who are now willing to give us military support in our future adventures."
 cli_imperial_cilli_title: "Imperial Cilli"
 cli_imperial_cilli_desc: "Ruling over a slavic state in the Holy Roman Empire means we have to try even harder to prove ourselves equal to the other princes. We need the best diplomats Celje can offer to help ous grow our influence in the south of the empire."
 cli_secure_electors_title: "Secure Electors"
 cli_secure_electors_desc: "With the Habsburg empire slowly collapsing we should aspire to get the electors on our side. With their backing we could continue where our friends from Bohemia left off after the death of Sigismund and lead the Holy Roman Empire to greatness."
 cli_charlemagne_throne_title: "Charlemagne Throne"
 cli_charlemagne_throne_desc: "Some think fairy tales are only used to blind people into believing that if they work hard then God will eventually grant them happines. But this time God was on our side. Once backwater nobles in a hilly region populated by Slavs, the Celjski now sit on the throne of the legendary father of Christian Europe. Gloria imperatoria Cilli!"

 #4
 cli_union_bosnia_title: "Union with Bosnia"
 cli_union_bosnia_desc: "Ever since Catherine of Bosnia from the dynasty of Kotromanic married with Herman I, the counts of Celjse have been tied to Bosnia. In 1427 a desperate king of Bosnia Tvrtko II Kotromanic looked for allies against the Ottomans. In a desperate attempt to get help from the catholics to his west, he agreed to name Herman II Celjski his heir. But Herman died in 1435 and Tvrtko II died not long after in 1443. Tomas, Tvrtkos relative and illegitimate son of the previous king Ostoja became the new ruler of Bosnia. The claims that the Celjski had on the Bosnian crown seem to have been forgotten. But we remember and we will take Bosnia by any means necessary, as only we can protect the Bosnian people against the Turkish threat."
 cli_depose_hercegs_title: "Depose the Hercegs"
 cli_depose_hercegs_desc: "Herzegovina was once an integral part of the kingdom of Bosnia. By conquering it we would reunite the Bosnian lands and forever gain the favor of the local population."
 cli_dominate_habsburgs_title: "Dominate the Habsburgs"
 cli_dominate_habsburgs_desc: "Vienna, the pearl on the Danube, or rather what is left of it has fallen to our troops. Our vengeance to years of Habsburg humiliation is complete. We will spare the people ov Vienna, but the city will be pillaged and its riches brought back to Celje."

 cli_war_habsburgs_title: "War with the Habsburgs"
 cli_war_habsburgs_desc: "The relations between the Habsburgs and the Celjski have been difficult to say the least. Although there were some important exceptions, especially when battling the Turks,the Cilli and Habsburgs were bitter rivals battling for control over Carniola and Styria. WIth our newly gained posessions in Hungary and the Balkans we are finally strong enough to take the duchy of Carniola adn the cities of Ljubljana and Trst for ourselves. No longer will we be treated as mere lower nobility by the arrogant Habsburgs."
 cli_unite_slovenians_title: "Unite the Slovenians"
 cli_unite_slovenians_desc: "We owe the Slovenian people a great deal for it is their blood that help us rise from the the lower nobility to becoming a major dynasty within the Holy Roman Empire. Having been split into several duchies ruled by the Habsburgs, it is time for us to repay them and unite them under our own realm where their culture will be not only preserved but also nurtured."
 cli_fall_stajerska_title: "Fall of Stajerska"
