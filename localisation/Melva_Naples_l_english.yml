 Melva_Naples_Events.2.T: "Regia Dogana della Mena delle Pecore di Puglia"
 Melva_Naples_Events.2.D: "In 1447 Alfonso I passed a series of laws, including the imposition on the Abruzzese and Molise shepherds to spend the winter within the Neapolitan borders, in the Tavoliere, where many of the cultivated lands were also forcibly transformed into pastures. It also established, based first in Lucera and then in Foggia, the Dogana della mena delle pecore in Puglia and the very important network of sheep tracks that from Abruzzo (which from 1532 would have its detachment of the Customs, the Doganella d'Abruzzo) led to the Capitanata. These measures revived the economy of the inland cities between L'Aquila and Puglia: the economic resources linked to the transhumant sheep farming of the Abruzzo Apennines were once dispersed in the Papal State, where the herds had hitherto wintered."

 Melva_Naples_Events.5.D: "Founded by Antonio Beccadelli (known as the "Panormita") in 1458, it was initially called Porticus Antonianus ("Portico di Antonio" in Latin). Some anticipate the birth of the academy in 1442, the year in which Alfonso I of Aragon, following his investiture as king of Naples, set up a very rich library in his house in Castel Capuano (later transferred to the Castel Nuovo) where they gathered men of culture to discuss literature and philosophy. In honor of him this association was called Accademia Alfonsina. From this would have descended directly that of Antonio Beccadelli, protected by the King himself."

Porta Capuana is the universal theater, it is the Cosmopoli of our people .. Here there is neither night nor day.\" \nBuilt in 1484 by the king [Root.Monarch.GetName] and, from the earliest stages, it was the access point coming from the east towards the city center, as well as being the nerve center of communications; in the eighteenth century the royal road of Puglia passed through it. It has therefore always been in a very lively area of Naples, and has also represented a place of artistic and cultural aggregation: it is in Porta Capuana, for example, that the so-called Latin Quarter was born at the beginning of the twentieth century, a meeting place for important Neapolitan artists of the time."

On May 30, 1445 he married [Root.Monarch.GetName], called Ferrante, later Duke of Calabria, natural son of Alfonso V of Aragon, who had risen to the throne of Naples as Alfonso I. It was the latter who arranged the marriage of his son favored with the heir of the Principality of Taranto, obtaining various advantages through this marriage. In the first place, Ferrante would succeed with his wife at the helm of the Principality, thus allowing the king and in the future Ferrante himself, destined to the throne, to confiscate one of the most important fiefdoms of the kingdom in their own domains. Furthermore, the kinship link allowed the sovereign to strengthen his power of influence over the Orsini of Taranto."

 Melva_Naples_Events.9.T: "Congiura dei baroni"
 Melva_Naples_Events.9.D: "The resistance opposed by the barons to the modernization of the state pursued by the Aragonese in Naples. The king [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Naples had aimed to dissolve the feudal particularism and make the royal power the sole lever of the life of the country. In this context, the clash with the barons inevitably arose around the big problem of an "organic reform of the state", the cornerstones of which were the reduction of baronial power, the development of economic life and the promotion of new entrepreneurs to the ruling class. Neapolitan merchants. An instrument of this policy was the fiscal reform, which entrusted new tasks to the municipal administrations (universities), encouraging them to escape, as far as possible, the feudal weight. And in truth it has been calculated that at that time in the Kingdom of Naples, out of 1550 inhabited centers, only a little more than 100 were assigned to the royal state property, that is, under the direct control of the king and the court, while all the others were controlled by the barons. This meant that the feudal power as a whole was the owner of the resources and finances of the kingdom and that the Aragonese court was in fact made subordinate to the baronial organization. It was therefore natural that the king favored in every way the numerical extension of the state-owned cities, removing them from the feudal weight and incorporating them into his own direct administration. But the undertaking was no small feat. The barons were organized into large, fairly branched dynasties, each of which alone controlled more lands than the king. The Orsini Del Balzo, for example, boasted of being able to travel from Taranto to Naples without ever leaving their possessions; the Sanseverinos, now opposed and now protected by the king, were owners of fiefs which from Calabria, through almost all of Basilicata, reached Salerno and lapped Naples; the Acquaviva, the Caldora, the Caracciolos, the Guevara and the Senerchia completed this small elite in power, which in fact surrounded the capital, suffocating the kingdom."
 Melva_Naples_Events.9.OPT1: "We will never meet their demands, the time of diplomacy is over!"

 Melva_Naples_Events.10.T: "Congiura dei baroni sedata"
 Melva_Naples_Events.10.D: "A first hard fight between the barons and King Ferrante had already occurred in the long war fought within the kingdom from 1459 to [GetYear]. The king had then obtained the help of many Italian captains, to whom had been added a contingent of 1000 infantry and 700 knights landed from the Adriatic overseas and led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu, the Albanian national hero in search of new lands for the his people dispersed by the Turks. The great losers of that war were Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, the last prince of Taranto, who died in Altamura in [GetYear], perhaps suffocated by the king himself through the archpriest of that church, and Antonio Caldora, duke of Bari, who after having been captured in [GetYear] during the siege of Vasto was stripped of all possessions by the sovereign. The fact is that the Orsini del Balzo then lost the vast territory of the Principality of Taranto, which was confiscated by the court, until the Church, after not long, claimed its direct power over Altamura with greater force, thus providing the Del Balzo , feudal lords of the city, an ecclesiastical administration more free from respect for the King and more loyal and faithful to the baron, while the Caldora, after having lost all their territories with that defeat, distributed for the most part in Abruzzo, Molise, in Capitanata and in the land of Bari, they never got up again. In short, the war against the barons of 1459-[GetYear] had ended bitterly, but with a clear victory for the king. He had then been able to resume his policy with greater certainty, innovating in fiscal and feudal legislation, that is, mortifying the baronial prerogatives, extending the power of the court and the state, reorganizing the economic and commercial life of the kingdom. The state-owned cities grew, albeit to an inadequate extent, and the barons underwent the royal initiative for some years. "

 Melva_Naples_Events.11.T: "The barons are happy"

Like earthquake and storm we will scorch all this earth and together we'll push deep the knife. The barons tonight surely die."

 Melva_Naples_Events.14.T: "Seconda Congiura dei Baroni"
 Melva_Naples_Events.14.D: "The conspiracy was hatched in 1485 by the prince of Salerno Antonello Sanseverino. The latter, advised by Antonello Petrucci, Francesco Coppola and Luigi Gesualdo da Caggiano, gathered around him many feudal families of lords and barons of the kingdom of the Guelph faction in favor of the Angevins, including the Caracciolo, princes of Melfi, the Gesualdo , marquises of Caggiano, the Del Balzo, princes of Altamura and dukes of Andria and Venosa, the Guevara, counts of Apice and Ariano, the Senerchia, counts of Rapone and Sant'Andrea, the aforementioned Caldora and the Sienese barons. The barons who had gathered in Melfi, while sharing the concerns expressed to them by Guevara, did not melval like taking immediate and irrevocable action against Alfonso: they did not believe it was possible at that moment to solicit the intervention of the pope or of the new suitors. Moreover, the memory of the bitter defeat suffered in 1464 still burned. But they did not even want the proposal to fall completely on deaf ears, and they entrusted Girolamo Sanseverino, prince of Bisignano and count of Tricarico and Miglionico, with an exploratory task, to verify at least the possible alliances, seek the consent of the other barons absent from the banquet of Melfi, and possibly attempt the ways of a negotiation with the king. Girolamo Sanseverino, to carry out this exploratory assignment, met in Naples with Petrucci and with Coppola, with the aim of testing the intentions of the court environments and measuring any subsequent steps on them. Obtained from them an interlocutory but not negative answer, a real summit of the Sanseverinos was immediately held in Diano, that is, in the very heart of their feudal possessions, between the Calabria, Basilicata and Salerno. The five most important exponents of this family took part, namely, in addition to Prince Girolamo, Antonello Sanseverino, prince of Salerno, Giovanna Sanseverino, widow of the count of Sanseverino, grandmother of Antonello and aunt of Girolamo, her son Barnaba, count of Lauria, and his other nephew Giovanni, count of Tursi. Meanwhile the Coppola was moving on another side. He had personally gone to King Ferrante to inform him of the growing discontent he had encountered among the barons and declared himself willing to act as an intermediary between them and the court, to watch from within the machination in progress and to turn it in favor of the monarchy. He thus entered with conviction in the mechanism of the conspiracy, also dragging the hesitant royal secretary Antonello Petrucci and his sons into it. In Coppola's intentions, the choice of this ambivalent position should have allowed him to move more easily and with greater personal advantage: on the one hand, in the capacity of the king's envoy, he could have met the barons without making the sovereign suspicious, and on the other he would have deserved the trust of the always suspicious barons, thus mortgaging a prominent place next to them in the event that, once the path of the agreement with the sovereign became impracticable, it was decided to really dethrone the $DYNASTY$ dynasty."
 Melva_Naples_Events.14.OPT1: "We will meet again, on the battlefield."

 Melva_Naples_Events.15.T: "The Barons have been defeated"
 Melva_Naples_Events.15.D: "But things turned out differently and the precautions and intentions of Coppola and Petrucci were completely nullified. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] would have defeated everyone in skill and cynicism. He began by willingly agreeing to Coppola's proposal; he began to treat him since then as a real agent in his service who infiltrated the conspiracy on his behalf. Using it for this purpose, he never ceased to reward him with positions and honors of great prestige. But this did not mean that he entrusted all the destinies of the dynasty to Coppola or renounced his own initiative, which he elaborated and pursued with determination, aided by his son Alfonso. In short, in this intricate affair, Coppola together with Petrucci certainly acted with great ruthlessness, and ended up, together with Petrucci and his two sons, to fall victim to the death trap that he himself had contributed to hatch and to trigger. But it should also be noted that all the characters, including the king, faced the risks of this game by playing it each on more than one table. \nThe plan envisaged by the conspirators was the following: the barons of the territories closest to the capital would have prevented the king from crossing them, thus interrupting the communications of Naples with the rest of the country. Once the capital was isolated, the pope and other reinforcements would be allowed to penetrate the territory of the kingdom on the border between the Papal State and the Abruzzi. In this, the pope would have availed himself of the help of John II of Lorraine, in the name of the old Angevin aspirations for Naples, and of Roberto Sanseverino, the first captain of Italy, who would have acted on behalf of the Republic of Venice, but also for account of his Neapolitan family members. The definitive conclusion of this movement occurred in [GetYear] in the Castel of [Root.Capital.GetName]. In the hall of the barons, the last exponents of the conspiracy against the Aragonese court were arrested and killed. It was [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself who invited the barons into the hall, with the excuse of celebrating the wedding of his niece. In reality this was a trap: the barons were arrested and put to death."

 Melva_Naples_Events.17.T: "Dream of Ladislao I"
 Melva_Naples_Events.17.D: "Tamed the internal pitfalls, Ladislao soon turned his attention outside the borders of his kingdom. It was in these years that the dream of building a great state reality that included the entire Italian peninsula, unified under the crown of Naples and the insignia of the Durazzo was born in him. The idea of a Kingdom of Italy that precedes the Risorgimento enterprise by more than four hundred years and to which Ladislao will dedicate all his efforts during his short life. In the years to come, in fact, he would take advantage of the crisis situation in which the composite Italian political reality was pouring to considerably expand his kingdom and his power above all to the detriment of the papal dominions, appropriating and disposing of many of the papal territories as he pleased. \nShould we reclaim the dream of Ladislao and focus on the creation of an Italian state?"
