 desc_feitoria_fort_elmina: "Elmina Castle was build by the Portuguese in 1482 as São Jorge da Mina Castle, also known simply as Mina or Feitoria da Mina. The fort was the first pre-fabricated building of European origin that was being planned and executed in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Portuguese sent all of the materials needed - from foundation stones to roof tiles and weaponry - to build the fort on ten caravels and two transport ships. Upon its completion, Elmina was established as a proper city and it took on the military and economic importance that had previously been held by the Portuguese factory at Arguim on the southern edge of the Moorish world. At the height of the gold trade in the early sixteenth century, 24.000 ounces of gold were exported annually from the Gold Coast, accounting for one-tenth of the world’s supply. The population of Elmina swelled with traders from other towns hoping to trade with the Portuguese, who gradually established a West-African monopoly."

 desc_feitoria_plantation_sao_tome: "The first successful settlement of São Tomé was established in 1493 by Álvaro Caminha, who received the land as a concession from the crown. Príncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however,  most of the earliest inhabitants were \"undesirables\" sent from Portugal, mostly Jews. In time, these settlers found the excellent volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of sugar. The cultivation of sugar was a labor-intensive process, and the Portuguese began to import large numbers of slaves from the African mainland. By the mid-16th century, the Portuguese settlers had turned the islands into Africa's foremost exporter of sugar."

 desc_vila_do_infante: "A town on the extreme southwest coast at Cabo de São Vicente which came to be called the Vila do Infante, or the Prince’s Town. Henry the Navigator attempted to concentrate the available nautical knowledge. Anchored in an area that seemed the gateway to the sea, the town was situated with the strait of Gibraltar to its south, the Mediterranean to its east, and the vast emptiness of the Atlantic to the west. It was a perfect harbor to nurse the fledgling ideas of the age of exploration and it was arguably here that the first rudimentary school for nautical navigation was built. The dedication he had towards expanding the available knowledge, techniques, and tools available for exploration brought imperialist desires to the forefront of most major powers’ agenda and catalyzed the age of exploration, trade, empire, and cultural interaction that would follow. During the time of Prince Henry and the following centuries, nautical science became the focus of many of Europe’s most prominent experts in mathematics, astronomy, geography, meteorology, and physics. By applying their specific areas of expertise to the problems of seafaring navigation, many of the statutes of sailing and precursors to modern navigation were born."

Travellers marvelled at \"Goa Dourada\", or Golden Goa. A Portuguese proverb said, \"He who has seen Goa need not see Lisbon\".
