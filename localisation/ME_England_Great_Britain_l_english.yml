 ENG_Hundred_Years_war_title: "The Hundred Years' War"
 ENG_Hundred_Years_war_desc: "The Treaty of Tours has brought an uneasy period of truce between us and the French. Both sides keep their forces mobilized at all times. It is obvious the truce will not stand the test of time."
 ENG_Scotland_title: "Safety of the Isle"
 ENG_Scotland_desc: "Before going campaigning on the mainland, firstly we are bound to protect the citizens of our home isle. It is only when their safety is ensured that we can organize an expedition to capture the French Throne. This exact safety of our citizenry may soon be disturbed with the Scottish efforts to renew the Auld Alliance. While we cannot be entirely sure whether the Scots would accept a French call-to-arms or not, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must make a move to secure our flank."
 ENG_Poitou_title: "Poitou Fortress"
 ENG_Poitou_desc: "On our path to capture the southern French provinces lies a towering castle in the proximity of Poitiers. As many previous wars have shown, such castles often become center of raiding parties meant to harass armies passing by. As such, it is our foremost mission to bring this french bastion to its knees. Just like the English army humiliated the French forces in 1356, the English army shall do so again."
 ENG_Angevin_Possesions_title: "City of Anjou"
 ENG_Angevin_Possesions_desc: "In the vicinity of the Maine lies the city of Anjou, the mighty capital of the Provencal branch of the Valois. Adding to the injury is the fact that the previously mentioned dynasty is allied to the French branch of the Valois which means that if the [Pro.MonarchGetName] is to honor their alliance, Angevin territory will prove to be a thorn in our side. It is crucial for our war efforts to eliminate this obstacle."
 ENG_Reclaim_Maine_title: "Reclaim Maine"
 ENG_Reclaim_Maine_desc: "In an effort to maintain control of the Maine, we attempted to bring to question the legitimacy of William de la Pole's negotiations. It became quite clear that our desperate attempts at keeping the province were poorly executed, as they resulted in the personal capture of Maine by the French King. Now, with the Hundred Years' War back in motion, it is time to recapture our city. [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall not be remembered as the king who lost Maine, but as the man who brought it back."
 ENG_Chartres_title: "Castle of Chartres"
 ENG_Chartres_desc: "On our way to the Paris exists a formidable fortress in Chartres, one that cannot be ignored during our march. It is certain that a victory in Paris cannot be achieved if we are to let this fort just stand there without a disturbance. It is of utmost importance for us to lay a siege to the castle and capture it in the name of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ENG_Paris_title: "Pearl of the West"
 ENG_Paris_desc: "At last, we have arrived at the gates of the grand city of the west - Paris. Captured previously by us in 1420. Since then, the French managed to liberate the city from our hands, and while that act may have boosted their morale greatly, we must prove them that it even their efforts to defeat us are in vain. Our recapture of the city shall be a great blow to them."
 ENG_Regional_control_title: "Control of the North"
 ENG_Regional_control_desc: "The northern areas of France are truly the core territory of the French realm. If we are to take hold of the north, then the loss for the French seems inevitable. Once the north is secured, the last bastion of the French King will become the south, which, while more defensive, will not stop the English onslaught."
 ENG_Path_to_victory_title: "Path to Victory"
 ENG_Path_to_victory_desc: "With the Northern France under our control and the gates of South open, the victory of the French seems far more improbable than ever. If we are to defeat the French more decisively, then we will truly be on the path to victory."
 ENG_Enforce_the_Union_title: "Enforce the Union"
 ENG_Enforce_the_Union_desc: "With our recent victories, it is high time to force the French King to get on his knees and hand over his crown to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Many will talk about this great victory for years to come."
 ENG_war_of_the_roses_title: "War of the Roses"
 ENG_war_of_the_roses_desc: "The crippling incompetence of Henry VI has led to whole factions trying to exploit him to exert control over the English Realm. These conflicts had resulted in two major factions being born - the faction of York represented by white rose and the faction of Lancaster represented by red rose. Both of these factions are struggling for control over the throne and a civil war seems imminent. We need to deal with it swiftly, whether it means preventing it or surviving it."
 ENG_demands_of_the_peasants_title: "Appease the Peasantry"
 ENG_demands_of_the_peasants_desc: "The peasants led by the so-called 'Jack Cade' have created a written manifesto under the name 'The Complaint of the Poor Commons of Kent'. In the manifesto, Cade's men accuse the crown of extorsion, perversion of justice and election fraud. Our spymaster also reports that Jack has a hefty amount of men at his disposal that he is not afraid to use to capture London with. We must deal with this threat, either by appeasing the peasants or by defeating them in battle."
 ENG_recover_from_the_great_slump_title: "End the Great Slump"
 ENG_recover_from_the_great_slump_desc: "Multiple harvest failures in the previous decades have ruined the economies of countless countries. To add to the injury, shortages of silver in Northern Europe have led to the breakdown of trade - the driving factor of our economy. It is crucial we end this commercial downturn as soon as possible."
 ENG_improve_taxation_title: "Improve Taxation"
 ENG_improve_taxation_desc: "With the Wars of the Roses and Hundred Years' War over, English Economy is in shambles. To combat this, we must establish ruthlessly effective taxation. 'Those nobles who spent little must have saved much, and thus they could afford the increased taxes; on the other hand, those nobles who spent much obviously had the means to pay the increased taxes.'"
 ENG_legitimate_king_title: "Legitimate King"
 ENG_legitimate_king_desc: "With the dreadful tragedies of the 15th century, such as the Great Slump and Wars of the Roses, came an uneasy time for the English Monarchy. People of all classes are displeased, as they firmly believe [Root.Monarch.GetName] won't be able to keep peace for long and that a second War of the Roses is upon us. Our beloved monarch must once again get in favour with the populace."
 ENG_a_new_religion_title: "A New Religion?"
 ENG_a_new_religion_desc: "With the policy of selling indulgences the church has been practising, it seemed inevitable that another heretic movement would have sprung up sooner or later. To nobody's surprise, the predictions were true and one of the monks has very openly described his discontent with the church paving the path for new the 'Reformation'. At the same time, the Pope is still refusing to give [Root.Monarch.GetName], so perhaps it's to defy the Papal Bull and to accept the teachings of the Reformators?"
 ENG_control_state_religion_title: "Control State Religion"
 ENG_control_state_religion_desc: "The general populace is refusing to convert to the new denomination of ours. Simultaneously, the King has not yet used full extent of his powers to promote the new faith among the people. Perhaps, it is the right time for the King to control state religion?"
 ENG_curb_down_the_unrest_title: "End the Unrest"
 ENG_curb_down_the_unrest_desc: "With new religions come religious strifes and turmoil. Our realm is no exception, as there are many counties where the new and the old clash in a violent fight. We must make sure the new has a clear path, which is why we need to curb down all rebellions and unrest, even if it means killing the people of our kind who rise up in rebellions."
 ENG_entrench_the_faith_title: "Entrench the Faith"
 ENG_entrench_the_faith_desc: "In history, religions have managed to split entire nationalities in half. We, of course, cannot let this happen and so we shall make '[Root.Religion.GetName] synonymous to [Root.Culture.GetName]."
 ENG_rival_the_nobles_title: "Rival the Nobles"
 ENG_rival_the_nobles_desc: "As we exhaust our troops on the battlefield, the nobles rake in tax money, abusing their privileges and their serfs as if mere jests. We cannot stand to let these corrupt bastards grow in power only to use it in such a manner. We must create a force to rival their private levies to ensure their cooperation."
 ENG_conquer_scotland_title: "Status of Scotland"
 ENG_conquer_scotland_desc: "These border skirmishes with the Scots have persisted long enough. They are but pawns in our grand chessboard; they cannot dare oppose us now. We shan't waste a single moment in fully occupying them."
 ENG_church_of_scotland_title: "Church of Scotland"
 ENG_church_of_scotland_desc: "The word of reformation has spread not only to us, but also to the Scottish who managed to form a church of their own. We must integrate this church into the Anglican tradition to further integrate the Scottish lands into our realm."
 ENG_conquer_brittany_title: "Conquer Brittany"
 ENG_conquer_brittany_desc: "Now, with the [Root.Monarch.GetName] restored back to the French throne, we have a plethora of lands to govern beyond the seas. In the rear of these lands lies the petit peninsula of the Bretons, the descendants of the people that lived on our isle many centuries ago. If they are not brought under our boot, they can prove to be a thorn in our side."
 ENG_seize_picardy_title: "Seize Picardy"
 ENG_seize_picardy_desc: "The English influence stretches from the Silver Coast up to the Norman waters. And while it is a truly a glorious feat to be had, it can stretch even further if we capture the coastal cities of Picardy"
 ENG_defeat_the_clans_title: "Defeat the Clans"
 ENG_defeat_the_clans_desc: "When we conquered the Scottish Lowlands, the Scottish King fled to the north, seeking refuge in his northern subjects. While, we have defeated the Scottish King once, he won't refrain from sending raiding parties from the green hills of the north. We must defeat him once again and his northern clans."
 ENG_seize_the_isles_title: "Seize the Isles"
 ENG_seize_the_isles_desc: "The unfathomable depths of the North Sea host many a cod for our delectable appetites. One would think the coastal waters of Britain would be enough, however this is not the case. The Faroe Islands, mere sprinkles of the sea, manage to outcompete our grand nation in surrounding waters, which is purely disgusting. We cannot let these mere fisherman best us."
 ENG_statute_of_westmister_title: "Statute of Westminster"
 ENG_statute_of_westmister_desc: "The Longbows are truly powerful, but we can't keep training forever. These powerful weapons require yew wood for manufactoring, which will eventually run short. To combat this, we may need to introduce a special tax for ships coming to our ports that will force them to carry four bowstaves per tun."
 ENG_ireland_title: "Kingdom of Ireland"
 ENG_ireland_desc: "In the year of our lord, 1155, Pope Adrian IV has issued that the English Kings are to be the 'Lords of Ireland' and have full permission to invade Ireland and bring Hibernia under European sphere of Influence. This means we have full right to subjugate this island and create the title of the Irish Kingdom."
 ENG_church_of_ireland_title: "Church of Ireland"
 ENG_church_of_ireland_desc: "Just like we have created the Church of England, we shall do the same to Ireland. Such institution would help us integrate the Irish into the government and bring them closer culturally to the inhabitants of the Eastern Isle."
 GBR_north_sea_trade_dominance_title: "Trade Dominance"
 GBR_north_sea_trade_dominance_desc: "While wealth of nations comes from many sources, our nation's economy is fueled mostly by trade. Coincidentally, trade can also be used as a political tool. If we become the domineering trading power in the North Sea, we will be able to exert more influence on the local nations."
 GBR_Peace_in_ireland_title: "Peace for Iceland"
 GBR_Peace_in_ireland_desc: "Hosts of cod sprinkle the sea, cod we must have. The Nordic tribes of Iceland field great hosts of cod, yet nearly no soldiers. They will fall victim to other imperialist scum if we do not incorporate them first, for their cod is the greatest temptation."
 GBR_naval_dominance_in_north_seas_title: "North Sea Dominance"
 GBR_naval_dominance_in_north_seas_desc: "With our beloved isle united, it is time we look into expansion opportunities overseas. One of the areas we can invade are the North Sea Islands and the land of vikings - Scandinavia. Yet, if we want to invade either of these, we need to gain a naval dominance to protect our invasion from being ruined."
 GBR_invade_norway_title: "Invade Norway"
 GBR_invade_norway_desc: "The Nature of Norwegian Traders causes the northern wealth to be retained in the North Sea, rather than moved into our coffers. If we are to be profiting, we need to remove this obstacle, even if it means a violent war overseas."
 # GBR_white_sea_contracts_title: "White Sea Contracts"
 # GBR_white_sea_contracts_desc: "Removed Missions"
 GBR_north_sea_empire_title: "North Sea Empire"
 GBR_north_sea_empire_desc: "Once upon a time, there was a large realm that indisputably ruled the North Sea. That state was the domain of Cnut the Great who had Denmark, England and Norway under his rule. It's time to bring this state back under the leadership of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 # GBR_surrender_and_regrant_title: "Surrender and Regrant"
 # GBR_surrender_and_regrant_desc: "Removed Mission"
 GBR_Irish_parliament_title: "Irish Parliament"
 GBR_Irish_parliament_desc: "Currently, our actions in Ireland seem illegitimate to the local populace. We can of course change that if we give the Irish provinces some representation in the Parliament. Such institution would be controlled by us, of course."
 GBR_Irish_plantations_title: "Plantations of Ireland"
 GBR_Irish_plantations_desc: "Integrating Ireland is proving a more difficult than expected. In this case, we must use a different kind of strategy: colonization. We shall confiscate the Irish lands and give them to settlers of our own. These planters will populate the Plantations of Ireland. Delightfully devilish."
 ENG_importance_of_wool_title: "Importance of Wool"
 ENG_importance_of_wool_desc: "The great Flemish artisans weave their cloth from our yarn, and this relationship has led us to be unmatched in quantity and quality in production. Wool is as important to us as cloth is to Flanders or Salt is to The Hansa. That exact importance is greatly reflected in our cultural heritage via idioms or monuments. 'I thank God and ever shall, it was the sheep that payed for all.'"
 ENG_trade_treaty_title: "Flemish Treaty"
 ENG_trade_treaty_desc: "It is high time to renew some of our Flemish trade treaties of old. Our wool and their cloth make an excellent connection on the markets of the war. As a result of previous trade treaties, many Flemish weavers started immigrating and setting up business all over England. They often took the surname 'Fleming' and their legacy is still within England. Let us tend the traditions of old."
 ENG_dutch_deal_title: "Trade Fleet"
 ENG_dutch_deal_desc: "A natural way to expand our trade sector is of course increasing the amount of merchant ships we posess. Currently, the amount we have is pathetic, at most. With this in mind, our next mission shall be to expand the trade fleet."
 ENG_markets_of_england_title: "Markets of England"
 ENG_markets_of_england_desc: "Trade to us is truly important as it accounts for roughly 40% of pur income. Due to this, the government has always deeply cared for the merchants of our nation. This century is, of course, no exception. Even in these decades of war and turmoil we shall support the trading class by building new exchange locations."
 ENG_monopolize_the_channel_title: "Monopolize the Channel"
 ENG_monopolize_the_channel_desc: "In this cruel world, we find ourselves surrounded on all sides by potential foes. These unknown enemies may very well scheme against us, whether it be militarily or diplomatically. One of these ways is of course leeching away from our main source of income: trade. Due to this, we need to monopolize the Channel's resources to our advantage."
 ENG_naval_power_title: "Naval Power"
 ENG_naval_power_desc: "Setting up overseas colonies or raiding foreign treasure fleets require a massive armada that can put pressure on colonial empires. Our current geopolitical situation gifts us with a long and developed coastline that is perfect for shipkeeping. It would be a waste not to increase the strength of our navy and send our most skilled admirals on privateer missions."
 ENG_seize_gibraltar_title: "Seize Gibraltar"
 ENG_seize_gibraltar_desc: "According to all known laws of seafaring, a ship is not able to to sail forever. The [Root.GetAdjective] ships of course abide these rules and so we, the skilled sailors that we truly are, know that that all boats can sail for limited time. Due to this, navies need to resupply every now and then. As a result of this, major stations focused around maintaining and supplying ships have sprung up. We most commonly refer to them as ports. And as we are trying to extend our naval reach, we need to acquire these safe havens for our ships if we are to rule the waves. One particular port that would serve great under the British command is the port of Gibraltar."
 GBR_mediterranean_islands_title: "Mediterranean Bases"
 GBR_mediterranean_islands_desc: "As we grow larger, so does our influence. Proportionally, the extent of our missions do too. To accommodate this exact growth we need not wait with expansion. To extend the naval reach in the Mediterranean world, we ought to get more havens to hoist our proud flag."
 GBR_conquer_egypt_title: "Granary of the Mediterranean"
 GBR_conquer_egypt_desc: "Most of the Colonial powers have already establish many factories along the African Coast. Meanwhile, few, if any, have established trading outposts on the northern part of the continent. A new brave world full of new opportunities lays open there. Due to this, it is high time we start venturing into the rich valley of the Nile."
 ENG_sabotage_colonizers_title: "Sabotage Caribbean"
 ENG_sabotage_colonizers_desc: "Had we known earlier about the riches of the New World, then perhaps we would be all the richer for it. The tales of brave Iberian Conquistadores spread far and wide due to the immense prestige they disclosed. Many smaller states have tried to explore the New Continent and find the Cities of Gold, but we've found a much less costly way of exploiting New World's wealth. The so-called 'Privateers' privately hired by us are serving our nation great by seizing foreign wealth and subsidizing the crown with it; we must make a fair use of them."
 ENG_english_exploration_title: "English Exploration"
 ENG_english_exploration_desc: "With the development of early Carracks and Caravels so came the age of exploration. In the eve of the 15th century, the Iberian explorers have gotten famous thanks to their discovery of a completely new continent. Consequently, plans to sail west were developed in England, but were eventually dropped due to inconvenient trade winds. Yet now, with the development of more modern naval tools, we are now able to conduct expeditions of our own."
 GBR_sun_never_sets_title: "Sun Shall Not Set"
 GBR_sun_never_sets_desc: "The nations, not so blest as thee,\nMust, in their turns, to tyrants fall;\nWhile thou shalt flourish great and free,\nThe dread and envy of them all.\nStill more majestic shalt thou rise,\nMore dreadful, from each foreign stroke;\nAs the loud blast that tears the skies,\nServes but to root thy native oak.\nThee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame:\nAll their attempts to bend thee down,\nWill but arouse thy generous flame;\nBut work their woe, and thy renown."
 ENG_colony_in_newfoundland_title: "Colony in Newfoundland"
 ENG_colony_in_newfoundland_desc: "While we have discovered much more than the 'Newfoundland', we have to start off simple. We haven't really sent any colonists on a mission yet, so settling in the close proximity to Britain that Newfoundland provides would be ideal for us. Furthermore, the island is surrounded with bodies of water that contain many fishes, especially cods."
 ENG_hudson_Bay_title: "Rupert's Land"
 ENG_hudson_Bay_desc: "As a global empire, we owe much to the ships that we sail on. These machines that let us travel hundreds of kilometres with ease of course need constant maintenance expansion. The most important resource for shipbuilding is timber, of course, which, though an easy resource to come by, is still required in massive amounts."
 ENG_royal_canada_title: "Royal Canada"
 ENG_royal_canada_desc: "Canada supplies The Isles with many crucial resources: fur, most commonly used in the clothing industry; timber, used for shipbuilding; and most importantly - manpower, the amount of men that can be pressed into service in our armies that will help us further expand beyond our borders."
 ENG_thirteen_colonies_title: "Thirteen Colonies"
 ENG_thirteen_colonies_desc: "With our foothold firmly established in the New World, we are now able to venture southward, into much more consoling climates. Besides that, it's time to show the world that [Root.Country.GetName] can establish a large, lasting colony and become the Colonial Empire it aims to be."
 GBR_beyond_appalachian_title: "American Trade"
 GBR_beyond_appalachian_desc: "During our previous missions to the new world we have learned of many local resources. And, as per human nature, we arrived here seeking gold, whether it would be gold that can be acquired raw of via the use of trade. And it must be noted, that we located our settlers in the right position to start a massive colony that would produce exotic goods for us."
 GBR_fair_taxation_title: "Fair Taxation"
 GBR_fair_taxation_desc: "The American Colonists really are a rebellious bunch. Actions to put out their enthusiasm ought to be done sooner or later as tensions in the colonies continue to rise without an end in sight. We need to extinguish their fire and tread on them, if necessary."
 ENG_intervene_in_caribbean_title: "Intervene in Caribbean"
 ENG_intervene_in_caribbean_desc: "Foreign powers have already established their cities along the chain of the Caribbean Archipelago. Unless we intervene in their schemes, they will be able to steer all the wealth from the Spanish Main up to Sevilla with no regard for the merchants of the Chesapeake Coast. This cannot be tolerated."
 ENG_jamaican_colony_title: "British West Indies"
 ENG_jamaican_colony_desc: "Had we known earlier of the riches Central America holds, we would undeniably have tried to contest the Spanish superiority in the Central America. However, at this point not much can be done. Though we may try to snatch a few coastal cities from them, massive invasion is out of the question."
 ENG_ivory_coast_title: "Coast of Ivory"
 ENG_ivory_coast_desc: "Legends speak of a faraway land in the east, full of riches and glory. That land is India, and due to the amazing work of Iberian Explorers, a waterway to it has been conceived. With this newly discovered route, for once doth the trade around Africa flourish. We must make  use of the trend that is happening and establish factories of our own."
 ENG_onto_the_Cape_title: "Onto the Cape"
 ENG_onto_the_Cape_desc: "With our settlements in Africa came in an influx of entrepreneurs and merchants who wished to exploit the discovery of the route to their advantage. It has become a daily sight of [Root.Adjective.GetName] ships passing by the factories of ours. Yet, with countless safe havens along the coast, sailing to and back from India is still a dangerous business to be had. As a result of many pirate raids and ship castaways, the East India Company has requested we set up a colony in the Cape of Good Hope, which is perfect spot for a haven due to the terrain it lays on."
 GBR_interior_title: "The Interior"
 GBR_interior_desc: "With the growth of Cape Colony came in an onslaught of adventurers. Of course, these men desired one thing only - gold. They have found exactly what they were looking for, alongside many other materials that sell well on the global markets. Currently, the area is infested with private mines of aforementioned entrepreneurs, though they lay under no protection whatsoever. It certainly would be worthy for the crown to establish a formal colony in these areas."
 ENG_indian_company_title: "Indian Company"
 ENG_indian_company_desc: "The East India Trade Company makes its profits by sailing with armadas of ships to the indies, buying goods on the local markets and bringing them back to Europe, where they are sold for profit. Sadly, a lot of the profit is lost due to the taxes that are taken by Indian Powers of ports of their own. If we are to secure several Indian Ports for our Trade Company though, we will be able to remove the middleman and gain more profits, at the same time keeping the Companies happy with the current government."
 ENG_penal_colony_title: "Penal Colony"
 ENG_penal_colony_desc: "The hypothesis of a massive Terra Australis continent has been partially confirmed with the expeditions of Lieutenant James Cook. While these lands lie far away, we possess the technology to establish colonial presence on the eastern coast. It may be worthwhile to use it as a penal colony as it would 'Economy to the Public, & Humanity to the Individual'."
 GBR_aden_company_title: "Aden Company"
 GBR_aden_company_desc: "Narrow waterways and valuable goods make Adenese trade essential for mercantile dominance in the region. By establishing a Royal Charter, we could rid the coasts of vile piracy as well as secure a launching point for future ventures of the Crown."
 GBR_Melaka_title: "A Strategic Port"
 GBR_Melaka_desc: "Malacca was founded by Parameswara in the 14th century. Soon after its founding, this city quickly rose to the status of an entrepot while eclipsing all of the trade centers of the region. This allowed Malacca to become The center of malayan life and culture. We must either capture Malacca or acquire a city that can rival it under our benevolent rule."
 GBR_british_malaya_title: "British Malaya"
 GBR_british_malaya_desc: "Due to the placement of the Region, ships travelling from Cathay and Spice Islands usually pass through the straits Malaya offers. This presents an opportunity to establish special tolls on ships stopping in our havens. With this in mind, [Root.Country.GetName] needs to establish more control of the areas."
 GBR_chinese_entrepot_title: "Chinese Entrepot"
 GBR_chinese_entrepot_desc: "As per the nature of Trade Companies, these institutions can greatly succeed with the help of the home country. This exact aid we've been providing has already resulted in great wealth coming to Britain. Yet, we cannot stop there, there are much more riches to acquire, especially in ports of Cathay."
 GBR_new_zealand_title: "New Zealand"
 GBR_new_zealand_desc: "When Lt. James Cook charted the Coast of Zealand, he came into contact with the people who call themselves Maori. They are the native population of the local isles and are split between many tribes often hostile to each other. With them being already divided, we need not split them any further. We will ensure they will be united under our governance."
 GBR_pacific_dominions_title: "Pacific Dominions"
 GBR_pacific_dominions_desc: "Pacific Islands, while tiny and deprived of resources, are still able to be an use for us. These little patches of land among endless seas are an ideal havens for our ships. One only needs to establish order on the island and control over nearby waters is firmly secured."
 GBR_spice_must_flow_title: "The Spice Must Flow"
 GBR_spice_must_flow_desc: "Spices are a commodity only the richest may afford. Yet, on the markets of the East, that luxury is relatively cheap. This exact fact must be exploited to our advantage and so the Spice Islands are due for a conquest."
 GBR_bengal_title: "Kingdom of Bengal"
 GBR_bengal_desc: "The riches of India are to be reckoned with. Our colonial ambitions grow overtime and with expectations rising, question of Indian wealth is asked once again. Our realm grows ever larger and the subcontinent remains divided. The powers of India won't withstand our invasion in that environment."
 GBR_coromandel_title: "Coromandel State"
 GBR_coromandel_desc: "The deed is done. Our conquest of India has officially begun. While our conquest mostly encompassed the wealthiest region of India, it did not include all that is prosperous. We must expand our control along the coast. After we have conquered Bengal, some of the indian tribes realized the threat that is upon them and now united against us, but as long as we expand slowly, their differences won't allow them to stop us."
 GBR_along_the_rivers_title: "Along the River"
 GBR_along_the_rivers_desc: "Along the great river of Ganges and surrounding bodies of water lies the granary of India which is able to uphold substantial amounts of population. While conquering the valley wouldn't bring much profit now, in the future these lands may provide auxiliary forces."
 GBR_conquer_tamils_title: "Conquer the Tamils"
 GBR_conquer_tamils_desc: "When Spice travelled from Spice Islands to Europe, it had to go through many middlemen. Amongst these were the Tamil merchants, who operate in the Southern India. Thanks to this, these traders quickly became wealthy while also enriching their region. As per our ambitions, we must subjugate them."
 GBR_indian_dominion_title: "British India"
 GBR_indian_dominion_desc: "Indian Subcontinent is surrounded with natural obstacles, which makes a power that controls its boundaries more resistant to outside expansion. If we are going to conquer India, then we must subjugate it completely leaving no swathes of land behind."

 #GBR_take_burma_desc: ""
 ENG_Permanent_army_title: "A Permanent Army"
 ENG_Permanent_army_desc: "Feudalism, though a blessing for many, has proven to be a thorn in our side. Powerful nobles have used the incompetence of past rulers to gain strength and exploit their power to influence the government. Clearly, an army made out of noble levies is not safe to have, that's why it's high time we transition to a more stationary form."
 ENG_Royal_Navy_title: "Royal Navy"
 ENG_Royal_Navy_desc: "Our Navy is the pride of our nation. It stands amongst the best of its kind, it is one of the more, if not the most powerful navies in the world. We need not stop at this point though, as being stronger than everyone doesn't mean being stronger than all of other realms together."
 GBR_Reform_Redcoats_title: "Redcoats"
 GBR_Reform_Redcoats_desc: "Known by the red uniforms they wear, The British soldiers are truly feared by our enemies. We cannot stop there, as we must establish harsher drills and strengthen the discipline of our redcoats to create an elite unit capable of defeating every enemy."
 GBR_Wooden_wall_title: "The Wooden Wall"
 GBR_Wooden_wall_desc: "We, the English, are not going to allow any foreigners onto our beautiful island!

Our ships, drifting among the winds of the Channel, on a big line not allowing enemies to pass by."
 ENG_the_mines_title: "The Mines"
 ENG_the_mines_desc: "England, though an island nation, is gifted with natural resources. We have copper, iron and even coal on the island! While coal is not particularly useful, the former two are used in weapon-making of all sorts. We need to expand the mines to aid the arms industry."
 ENG_workshops_title: "Workshops"
 ENG_workshops_desc: "With technological progression, old ways have to step aside to allow the new. In this case, old ways of manufacturing have to give in to the workshops, which will greatly impact our production capabilities."
 ENG_manufactories_title: "Manufactories"
 ENG_manufactories_desc: "Back in the 15th century, nobody expected there would be an improvement over the workshops. Everyone firmly believed that it was the peak technological advancement. Yet, they were wrong. Once again innovation knocks on our door and presents a way of productivity never seen before. We need to embrace the new ways and start the early industrialization."
 ENG_naval_infrastructure_title: "Naval Infrastructure"
 ENG_naval_infrastructure_desc: "As a primarily coastal nation, navy is highly valuable to us. While disregarded by many, fleets do, indeed, win wars. There are dozens and dozens of tactics that are only executable with the help of the navy. To aid the growth of our armada, we need to prepare special infrastructure for it."
 ENG_Renaissance_title: "English Renaissance"
 ENG_Renaissance_desc: "The Renaissance is a new way of perceiving the world that originates from Italy and is slowly spreading to all parts of Europe. This train of thought has also reached our island. There are already many prominent men who are writing literature in their own, unique style that is inspired by the renaissance way of thinking. We must fully embrace this view of world."
 ENG_oxbridge_title: "Support the Oxbridge"
 ENG_oxbridge_desc: "The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are in the lead of providing new, innovative technologies to the state. It is the brightest minds of Oxbridge that shape the way we live and operate. We can't afford to let these schools of thought decline, for without them, we will not be as powerful as we are currently."
 ENG_charter_press_title: "Charter the Press"
 ENG_charter_press_desc: "With Printing Press slowly revolutionizing the way we read and spread knowledge, changes were imminent to come.

[Root.Monarch.GetName] can of course charter their press and consequently give them more opportunities to disseminate the knowledge amongst the countrymen."
 ENG_enlightenment_title: "Enlightened Ideals"
 ENG_enlightenment_desc: "Enlightenment, similarly to Renaissance, is a new way of perceiving the world. Once again, it comes with a new generation of thinkers, such as John Locke, Isaac Newton and many more. Due to the prominence it is gaining, we can fairly assume that it will be the next big thing, and so it is due for embracement."
 ENG_elisabeth_title: "Elisabethan Theatre"
 ENG_elisabeth_desc: "One of the most declaring ways the Renaissance lives in our culture is the Literature. With the Renaissance way of thinking, the Theatre has gone under a massive shift due to the influence of men like William Shakespeare. Writers like these help shape our country as a beacon of innovation and culture. We need to hire these men and encourage them to keep doing the good work."
 GBR_exploit_the_mine_fields_title: "Industrial Integration"
 GBR_exploit_the_mine_fields_desc: "We live in enlightened times. Around us, we can see innovations being made that will completely change the world we live in. Everything will be reshaped, including the lives of future people due to this revolution. The source of this revolution? - Coal. We need to integrate the coal fields into the industry of the state and make the lives of our children brighter."
 GBR_Industrialization_title: "Industrialization"
 GBR_Industrialization_desc: "With the coal mines ready and the industrialization kicking in, it is time to sit back and see the new technologies spread among the people. But this is not the end yet, for we have to constantly aid the industry with new furnaces, so that the industrialization ultimately fail."
 GBR_portsmouth_title: "Portsmouth"
 GBR_portsmouth_desc: "Portsmouth is one of the main dockyards of England is an ideal place for a large haven which can provide space for the ships protecting our interests in the Channel. Furthermore, Portsmouth should be elevated to the status of Royal Dock, as it was by Henry VII."
 GBR_plymouth_title: "Plymouth"
 GBR_plymouth_desc: "While Portsmouth is the largest dockyard currently, a growing navy needs more than one port to function properly. That's why Plymouth, or rather HMS Devonport, has been chosen to take the honorary place as the second port of the English state. It's strategic position resembles Portsmouth, but unlike the former, it is closer to the New World which helps in quicker response time."
 ENG_chart_india_title: "Chart India"
 ENG_chart_india_desc: "While Vasco Da Gama has already discovered the trade route to India, the Portuguese Government hasn't really shared the map with anyone else. Though, we have a confirmation from our spies that such a discovery was indeed made and one needs to sail around Africa to chart India. If our faithful ally won't share their maps with us, then fine, we'll do it ourselves."
 ENG_Pacific_exploration_title: "Tranquil Voyages"
 ENG_Pacific_exploration_desc: "Beyond the Terra Australis lies a massive ocean that is yet to be explored. Happily, we have several explorers under our service who would be willing to go on such a long tranquil voyage. Maybe there's a massive landmass in the middle of it?"
 GBR_seven_seas_title: "Chart Seven Seas"

 me_War_roses: "Had the disaster '§YWar of the Roses§!'"

 # Events:
 ME_England_Events.1.t: "Maine Reclaimed"
 ME_England_Events.1.d: "Ever since the French have captured the city, the English Loyalists have stayed in hiding to avoid persecution by the French. However, on this blessed day, the aforementioned men are able to go out of hiding and finally be free to express their loyalty to us. The mentioned men formed a mob that is currently welcoming our forces into the city of Maine. Lots of the men want to commit to the war effort and boost our dwindling manpower reserves."
 ME_England_Events.1.a: "Forward, to glory!"

 ME_England_Events.2.t: "The Second Treaty of Tours"
 ME_England_Events.2.d: "At last, we are victorious. The war that lasted a hundred years is finally over. Alas, many have lost their lives, both civilians and soldiers. Villages were burned, cities were sacked, lands of France - devastated. But now, the war is finally over. Order has been restored to the French Lands, a new order. The French Kingdom lies at our mercy. It is time for the second Treaty of Tours."
 ME_England_Events.2.a: "We must focus on the continental affairs."
 ME_England_Events.2.b: "This kingdom will make a fine addition to my collection."

 ME_England_Events.3.t: "Jack Cade's Rebellion"
 ME_England_Events.3.d: "Angered by the events of the Hundred Years' War and the taxes that came with it, peasants have risen up in a rebellion against the government as we could not cope with their demands. The rebels claim that the current regime is corrupt and the king's court is abusing its powers. Inspired by previous rebellions, the peasantry of Sussex and Kent have risen up in a revolt against the government and are now on the march to seize London."
 ME_England_Events.3.a: "Damn Them!"

 ME_England_Events.4.t: "Book of Common Prayer"
 ME_England_Events.4.d: "To aid in clerical influence over the commonfolk, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his council of advisors have come up with the novel idea to introduce a special compendium of ceremonies and prayer that would help to induce religious unity across the nation's innumerable churches. In all English lands, the 'Book of Common Prayer' is to be as the standard of faith and ceremony, effectively pairing with the dissolution of monasteries to assert religious unity and control over the people. One question remains as to the nature of this introduction: to what degree shall we rush to spread this compendium?"
 ME_England_Events.4.a: "Gradual introduction will serve us best"
 ME_England_Events.4.b: "The faster, the better!"

 ME_England_Events.5.t: "Pilgrimage of Grace"
 ME_England_Events.5.d: "With the consolidation of religious matters in the hands of the state, the nation has entered a hopefully temporary state of turmoil akin to chaos. With the dissolution of monasteries and other religious developments, our state finds itself met with pure iconoclastic rage, enough to inspire fear in the brave man's soul. The trumpets of rebellion sing their jaunty tune; the people of the north call for revolt. Their Pilgrimage is upon us."
 ME_England_Events.5.a: "Fools!"

 ME_England_Events.7.t: "Statutes of Iona"
 ME_England_Events.7.d: "With the establishment of state-funded schools in the Lowlands and our glorious conquest of the northern clans, we are now left with unruly clans that still resist our laws and try to govern themselves. The so-designated 'Statutes of Iona' are to end this cultural war and to bring the Highlander cultures closer to the much more English-like Lowlander Scottish."
 ME_England_Events.7.a: "Adopt the Statutes"
 ME_England_Events.7.b: "The clans should be left alone"

 ME_England_Events.9.t: "Work of William Caxton"
 ME_England_Events.9.d: "In our land of opportunity, another man succeeds. A Kentish man, William Caxton, aged 54, has established a printing press in Westminster. Year previously, he translated and printed the 'Recuyell of the Histories of Troye'. He even started working on a Encyclopaedia, which is soon due to finish."
 ME_England_Events.9.a: "Splendid!"

 ME_England_Events.10.t: "The Icy Grip of Death"
 ME_England_Events.10.d: "The once merry tune of church bells seems to fade unto the grey morning mist. At a time a source of joy, they call forth the open casket of our dear [Root.Monarch.GetName], pride and joy to all who served beneath him. As the bells slow, an eerie tune begins to sound throughout [Root.Capital.GetName]. Our former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s body moves slowly through the city, without motion and without an heir to bequeath the throne. The [Root.GovernmentName] lay in ruin, and the succession remains untaken. There is but one person to seize our throne now. King of the Scots, [SCO.Monarch.GetName] was a distant to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and thus is the only seemingly legitimate heir to our lands."
 ME_England_Events.10.a: "Our relative in Scotland shall proceed to rule [Root.GetName]"
 ME_England_Events.10.b: "Let us appoint a local noble instead."

 ME_England_Events.11.t: "An Unresolved Conflict"
 ME_England_Events.11.d: "In spite of the countless wars and ceasefires, the conflict between the French and English Kingdoms stands unresolved. Throughout the years the [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] claim to the French throne is growing weaker and weaker. It is time to strike the French Kingdom before our claim to their throne becomes nothing but a mere laughingstock for other european monarchs."
 ME_England_Events.11.a: "We will prevail!"

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.t: "Trade Company Conflict"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.d: "Several prominent trade companies have engaged in a skirmish regarding the rights to a certain naval passage. Though the true possessor of these rights is clear, granting them to the opposing side is not an idea without merit."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.a: "Support the righteous one."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.b: "Accept the bribe from the other side."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.t: "New Company Created"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.d: "A new trade company has emerged, but not without opposition. The burgher coalition has no quarrels with its foundation, but detests any words of granting it a monopoly."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.a: "Give them Royal Charter."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.b: "They should not have a monopoly."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.t: "Mercantile Plans"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.d: "Several members of a prominent burgher family have approached us with plans for a new trade company. Should we accept, we grant a royal monopoly in return for a considerable portion of the proceedings."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.a: "Fund them."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.b: "We cannot afford to spend the royal ducats."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.t: "Mercantile Plot"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.d: "A plot involving several important seats of Parliament taking bribes has come to light. The gilded corruptor in question happens to be a prominent trading company, soiling governance for their own gain."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.a: "With Sin comes punishment."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.b: "We shan't oppose their actions."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.t: "Company in Ruin"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.d: "A major trade company, through abhorrant spending practices, has gone bankrupt and is in the process of defaulting on their loans. Such proceedings would greatly damage regional trade."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.a: "Save them."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.b: "They have naught to blame but themselves."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.t: "Company Stock"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.d: "Rumor has it that a major company's stocks may be on the rise. Though we have no confirmation, if this is true, not investing would be a grave error."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.a: "We would rather invest and regret than the converse."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.b: "Such risks are beneath us."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.t: "Colonial Conflict"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.d: "A conflict has arisen regarding rights to a certain valuable plot of land. The clergy claim it as their own, and have already begun constructing a church at the location. However, we seem to have granted the same land to a nearby trade company for an outpost. The two factions cannot coincide; how shall we proceed?"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.a: "Allow construction of the outpost."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.b: "Cede the land to the church."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.t: "Trade Companies Demand Rights"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.d: "Several prominent trade companies of the nation have grown discontented despite their existing charters. They demand additional monopolies, and are prepared to back up their demands with steel."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.a: "Humour their petty demands."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.b: "Their complaining is of no consequence."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.t: "Rival Nation"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.d: "Our trade companies face steep resistance, and royal charters only go so far. In the face of foreign competition, our merchants have not been faring particularly well. Shall we step up to the challenge?"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.a: "Mercantilism first!"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.b: "We shan't anger the powers that be."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.t: "Stock Crash"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.d: "Perhaps hindsight is useless, but we really should have seen this coming. Ever since the establishment of the stock market, nobles and burghers alike have speculated heavily on upward trends, consequences be damned. The market is now in a downward spiral, with only future plummets in sight."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.a: "Save the market!"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.b: "Let it sort itself out."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.t: "Rise of the Trade Companies"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.d: "Not all done in the name of profits ends well. All investments involve risk, and in this case, the risk of economic collapse has become all too real. Several important trade companies have risen to power, going beyond their charter and exerting economic influence on the motherland. We may be too late to stop the chaos."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.a: "Worrisome."

 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.t: "Trade Companies Losing Influence"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.d: "Just as the economy has booms and recessions, so too do the trade companies that exert considerable influence upon it. Through some abhorrent spending practices, the trade companies have been forced to rescind their new influence and return to the confines of their charters."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.a: "Marvelous!"
