#Events
 ME_Manchu_Events.1.T: "Rise of the Jiu Han Jun"
 ME_Manchu_Events.1.D: "Our military conquests of China have fared well for us, but our strategic use of propaganda against the Ming has reaped greater benefits than we could have ever imagined! The Ming bureaucrats did not favor their military, fearing that the officers would become too influential... It was only logical that we would use this weakness against the Ming and let it be known that their skills would be appreciated under Manchu rule. Defectors were promised leading positions underneath the new government, as well as royal marriages with Manchu nobility.\n\nThis should certainly be enough to sweeten the deal..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.1.OPT1: "Is that a revolt I hear?"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.2.T: "Great Jin Proclaimed"
 ME_Manchu_Events.2.D: "The growing strength of the Manchu nation has given us a greater ambitions. We much challenge the Ming, and face our destiny as future rulers of China. The Mandate of Heaven is all but lost for them..."

 ME_Manchu_Events.3.D: "Announced by the founding Khan, Nurhaci, on May 7, 1618, the Seven Grievances were a list of crimes perpetrated by the Ming against the Manchu. They were as follows:\n\n1. The Ming killed Nurhaci's father and grandfather without reason\n\n2. The Ming suppressed Jianzhou and favored Yehe and Hada clans\n\n3. The Ming violated agreement of territories with Nurhac\n\n4. The Ming sent troops to protect Yehe against Jianzhou\n\n5. The Ming supported Yehe to break its promise to Nurhaci\n\n6. The Ming forced Nurhaci to give up the lands in Chaihe, Sancha and Fuan\n\n7. The Ming's official Shang Bozhi abused his power and rode roughshod over the people."

 ME_Manchu_Events.5.T: "A Written Language for The Manchu People"
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.D: "The Jurchen Script has been in use by the Jurchen tribes since at least the 1100's, but the native written language has gradually fallen out of favor to be replaced by the neighboring Mongol's written word; another minority have taken up the Chinese system instead. Should we preserve our native word and improve upon it, or adopt a more pragmatic approach?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.OPT1: "We will create the Manchu Script."
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.OPT2: "We will adopt the Mongol custom."
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.OPT3: "We Will adopt the Chinese custom."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.T: "The Mandate of Heaven"
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.D: "The Mandate of Heaven is an institution which goes back to even the Ancient times of China. Over the course of the years, many rules and conquerors have come to lose and claim it. The wheels of time have turned once again, and the Heavens have deemed the Ming incapable of ruling China. It is obvious who they favor... but should we take up the Mantle and rule as the Son of Heaven, or reject these ideals and rule as Khan?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.OPT2: "Out with the old, in with the new! I am the Khan!"

 ME_Manchu_Events.8.OPT2: "We can't lower our standards..."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.T: "The Mongol Eight Banners"
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.D: "Our expansion into the wild steppes have brought with it the assimilation of the Mongol nomads who inhabit it. While fierce and certainly with a reputation, it would not be wise to haphazardly mix them amongst our people. Perhaps we should create a similar Banner system for the Mongols who serve us?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.OPT1: "An excellent idea!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.OPT2: "There's no need for that..."
