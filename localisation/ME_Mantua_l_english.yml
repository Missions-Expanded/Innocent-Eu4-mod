 man_great_patrons_desc: "The Gonzagas were enlightened patrons who managed to attract some of the greatest Italian and European artists to their court at various times. With Ludovico III, Andrea Mantegna was appointed court painter and Leon Battista Alberti began the construction of the Basilica of Sant'Andrea. With Isabella d'Este, marquise consort of Francesco II, in 1490, he made Mantua one of the greatest centers of art collecting. With Frederick II, Giulio Romano built Palazzo Te. Vincenzo I was one of the most important collectors of the time and Rubens accepted the post of court painter, retaining this position until the end of his stay in Italy. Ferdinando welcomed the Flemish painter Van Dyck, Domenico Fetti, Carlo Saraceni and Francesco Albani to his court, who decorated Villa Favorita for the duke."
 man_gallery_title: "The Gallery"
 man_gallery_desc: "The Gonzagas supported and sponsored numerous artists in order to give prestige to their family; they were important collectors of works of art, second only to the popes and the Medici. The paintings and objects were mainly exhibited in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua, configuring itself as a real museum within the museum. Ferdinando Gonzaga, returning from Rome on the occasion of his appointment as Duke of Mantua, found in the palaces very rich artistic endowments, which required a work of cataloging. He personally took care of the reorganization, cataloging and placement of art objects. The family could boast the most important museum in Europe, with 20,000 precious objects and 1,800 paintings by the most prestigious artists. Despite his passion for art, shortly before his death, Ferdinando, in order to at least partially settle a disastrous debt situation, had initiated contacts for the sale of a part of the famous collection of works of art accumulated over the years from the family."

The marshals began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhytm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side."

 man_conquest_venetia_desc: "The sun was already westering as they rode from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], and the light of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Veneto to a golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, aid this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the Alps loomed, even darker and taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind."

 man_trading_venice_desc: "The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the man from the lagoon. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, and still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the canals gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. In the St Mark's square the host of our horses roared like a sea, swarmed about its feet from end to end. Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Mercenaries sprang up them like apes in the dark forest of the South. Before the Cathedral's door the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on."

At last they saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Alps. Down the hillside the younglings, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. One the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud."

 man_lombardo_veneto_desc: "It was a deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. Mist of shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings and a murmur like voices passing. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lighting far away across the Valley, Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed."

 man_gonzaga_ruling_desc: "The Gonzagas were not only collectors of important works of art. They also engaged in the breeding of horses (the "Mantuan Berbers"), for entertainment and for wars, since the fifteenth century. Many of these animals were immortalized by various painters in the halls of their palaces (including the Sala dei Cavalli in Palazzo Te). The family was famous for the wealth of books contained in their libraries, many of which dealt with zoology and botany. The Gonzagas built real zoological gardens inside their courts where, thanks to the favors they enjoyed with the powerful families of the time, there were ostriches, lions, falcons and hunting dogs. The lords of Mantua also owned illuminated books, Roman medallions and elephant tusks. Isabella d'Este also collected shells, coral branches and rare fish teeth. His son Frederick II asked foreign merchants for a leopard to be trained in hunting, a mongoose to kill snakes and several alligators."

 man_plains_emilia_desc: "With astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round. Soon the companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen moving  in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. Without a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had guns in hand, and their fingers were already fitted to the trigger. The one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed."
 man_horse_lords_title: "Horse-Lords"
 man_horse_lords_desc: "The Gonzagas, lords of Mantua, were important patrons and went down in history also for having been great admirers and important horse breeders, appreciated and become famous in all the courts of Europe. \nThe first news of a horse breeding dates back to the mid-fifteenth century at the time of the Marquis Ludovico III Gonzaga, who intended to use them for poles and tournaments, entering into competitions with the great families of the time Medici, Estensi and Farnese. The Marquis Francesco II Gonzaga, a proud breeder who owned 125 specimens at the end of the fifteenth century, called his Berber horses "la raza nostra de casa"."

 man_war_lombardy_desc: "As they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of the Golenali forest loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Lombard, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrow sticking in back or throat. At last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. War is coming."

 man_fall_visconti_desc: "Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a Lombard officer's head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears. The last vestiges of the Visconti are no more, the remnants of their armies run shattered in the fields outside the cities seeking for salvation from the horse lord of Mantua."
 man_helm_dynasties_title: "The Helm of Dynasties"
 man_helm_dynasties_desc: "The dark gates were swung open. The horsemen entered, walking in file behind their guide. They found a broad path, paved with hewn stones, now winding upward, now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps. Many houses built of elegant bricks and many dark doors they passed. Beside the way in a stone channel a stream of clear water flowed, sparkling and chattering. At length they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above a green terrace, at the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone carved in the likeness of a horse's head; beneath was a wide basin from which the water spilled and fed the falling stream. Up the green terrace went a stair of stone, high and broad, and on either side of the topmost step were stone-hewn seats. There sat other guards, with drawn swords laid upon their knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders; the sun was blazoned upon their green shields, their long corslets were burnished bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men."

Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined.

Founded in the territory of the former Castrice County, it was outside the borders of the kingdom of France, but on the territories subject to the Holy Roman Empire. The Duke of Rethel then relied on this new capital to create a sovereign principality, not a vassal of the kings of France, which took the name of the previous manor: Arches. Charles I declared Charleville the capital of the sovereign principality of Arches and a monastic city; this allowed him to expand his influence in northern Europe, a stone's throw from the two rich regions, Flanders and Holland. The Principality and Charleville, its capital, had the same heraldic weapon."

The oratory, completed in 1055, was built on the ruins of the Hospital of Sant'Andrea and contiguous to the monastery, built by Bishop Itolfo in 1037. With the discovery of a second relic in 1049, the Benedictine monastery was rebuilt. The only remains currently visible are the Gothic bell tower and one side of the cloister. The church was finally definitively restructured starting from 1472, on a project by Leon Battista Alberti commissioned by the lord of Mantua Ludovico II Gonzaga (and his son Francesco, cardinal), who wanted to make it a symbol of his power over the city and the prestige of the family. . The purpose of the new building was to welcome the pilgrims who came during the feast of the Ascension, during which a vial containing what is believed to be the blood of Christ was venerated, brought to Mantua, according to tradition, by the centurion Longinus. The relic, much venerated starting from the Middle Ages but especially in the 15th century, and carried in procession through the streets of the city on Good Friday, is now preserved in the Sacred Vessels kept inside the altar located in the crypt of the basilica."

A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. Once entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and filled with avenues and groves of fruitful trees, watered by stream that flowed from the mountains to a lake."

They set an example for other European courts, particularly in their patronage of contemporary artists, whilst their collecting increased the international profile of Mantua, a relatively small state. It reached its peak under Vincenzo I Gonzaga and his son Ferdinando, before the family's decline led to major losses from the collection, such as the long negotiations from 1625 onwards with Charles I of Great Britain, mediated by two members of the Whitehall Group - the Flemish art dealer Daniel Nys and Nicholas Lanier, Master of the King's Music."

The true quality of the island of Murano, however, was the man with the experience of him, who over time has perfected the styles, the quality and the ability to shape the incandescent glass. These glass artists have always been contacted since the Renaissance to bring their skills to the courts and workshops, so much so that they became masters. In fact, for this reason, a glass school was activated in Murano that initiated young people to this profession even if the experience in the glass factory remained unique. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Murano glass was required by the highest social classes in Europe starting with the invention of crystal in about 1450; in fact the crystal is a quality of glass that differs and that gives the glass itself some peculiar characteristics due to the same silicon base but to a higher percentage of lead oxide (24%), so the products created were particularly refined to satisfy the demand for extremely wealthy clients."
