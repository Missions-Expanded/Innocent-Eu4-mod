 WES_forcelimit_title: "[Root.GetName]'s Guard"
 WES_forcelimit_desc: "The pride of Westphalia lies in the guard of the King: The army. It's our ultimate wall - Our line of defence - against the external enemies that are our fellow Germans. And yet, despite how glorious the Guard is, it is lacking. It is not perfect enough for a nation like Westphalia. It is lacking in the field of technology, size, and military strategies. We ought to fix that."
 WES_secure_westphalia_title: "Grow the State"
 WES_secure_westphalia_desc: "Westphalia is a kingdom with little history behind it, yet this is our greatest strength. It means our nation is not an old one much like the Romans, Ottomans or French that are slowly stagnating or even collapsed.

If we are to make Westphalia into a meaningful footnote in History we need to expand our state and fulfill our very own destiny."
 WES_westphalia_title: "Dux Orientalis Saxonum"
 WES_westphalia_desc: "If there is any realm of yore we have ancestry towards then it would be Saxony. Large swathes of land that we control belong  to the Old Saxony.

Let us lay waste upon our enemies and carve up Old Saxony of the North as part of Westphalia proper."
 WES_rhineland_title: "Herzog von Westfalen"
 WES_rhineland_desc: "Natural borders of Westphalia go along the Rhine, as that is where the region of Westfalen exists. It would be quite improper of us to be the Kingdom of Westphalia while not reigning rule over our namesake that we have rights to."
 WES_army_title: "Grow our Forces"
 WES_army_desc: "As times change so do need for different weaponry and tactics. Traditions, though helpful at preserving useful battle tactics, often become outdated when new weapons get invented and introduced to the army.

 WES_city_fortifications_title: "City Fortifications"
 WES_city_fortifications_desc: "Our cities are filled to the fullest with beautiful architecture. Not only that but they are also the beating heart of our economy. In times of war our cities are at risk of being sieged down and sacked by enemy forces, tarnishing and scarring our nation. We need to slow down and lessen the amount of damage our enemies can cause upon us in war. To do this we need to fortify every city of importance that exists in Westphalia. No Urban Westphalian shall ever again experience the dread of open plains from where the enemy can come unstopped. The urban Westphalians shall be surrounded by the symbol of protection - wall."
 WES_renaissance_title: "[Root.GetWestphaliaRenaissanceMissionTitle]"
 WES_renaissance_desc: "Like a disease Renaissance has spread from Italy all across Europe. Unlike a disease it has some uses besides in warfare, as it can be used to promote intellectual exchange and interactions, thus helping with innovation and progress of our state. We ought to embrace the Renaissance if we are to motivate and support our artists, intellectuals, and scientists towards bettering Westphalia technologically and culturally."

 WES_reformation_title: "Reformation"
 WES_reformation_desc: "Nails were placed against a piece of paper and a church's door, and from it came a wildfire named Reformation. It spread far and wide and brought with it pain and destruction upon the citizens of Holy Roman Empire. Pope's authority has been questioned, and with it comes a potential - a choice. Westphalia's stance on Reformation is a bit uncertain: It can be seen as beneficial for us to help Pope re-assert spiritual reign over the Germans or we may embrace the Reformation and liberate ourselves slowly piece-by-piece from the foreign Italians. Our path remains uncertain and is up to our Monarch to decide."
 WES_expand_city_title: "Expand the City"

 WES_religion_title: "[Root.Capital.GetAdjective] Dom"
 WES_religion_desc: "Our faith is subpar. Our virtue is subpar. Our devoutness to Christ is subpar. This can't be allowed to stand. We need to change the sin and darkness that shrouds the Northern Germany and turn us into a location reminiscient of the virtuous Southern Germany. Temples shall be built, church attendance shall be reinforced, and our clergy shall receive their fairshare of donations. All in name of ensuring our faith is strong in our subjects."
 WES_estates_title: "Quell the Estates"
 WES_estates_desc: "The estates are parasites given false appearance of civility. On surface they may appear noble and just, but once you go below the skin their decadence and corruption become apparent. We should treat our estates as what they are - vermin requiring some pesticide to quell down their tainted clutch in the affairs of the state."
 WES_assert_control_title: "Assert Control"
 WES_assert_control_desc: "The Monarch serves no one but God. His right to rule is gained from God up above. He should not serve any lowly estates that are beneath him, nor a foreign ruler ruling from a den of sin. The absolute authority in Westphalia is the King and we need to ensure this remains as the ultimate fact."
 OLD_Denmark_title: "The House of von Oldenburg"

 MUN_a_new_jerusalem_desc: "When Anabaptists took control over the city of Münster in the midst of the Reformation's chaos, they hailed it as a 'New Jerusalem'. Rightfully so! While our city may not be as holy and grand, it is certainly no less pious."
 CLB_guelphs_title: "Welf Lineage"

 ME_Westphalian_Events.1.d: "We have been most faithful servants to the God above. Surely the current Pope, [PAP.Monarch.GetName], would grant us one of his famous 'Holy Favors'? After all, the system favors the pious, not the ones with deep pockets, right?"

 ME_Westphalian_Events.8.d: "Currently our judiciry is almost non-existant. All across the country, the relicts of the past principalities remain in the form of old laws, still enforced by local patrimonial courts. We have the means to unite the laws into one codex, but it is sure to upset the nobles, especially if sudden."
 ME_Westphalian_Events.8.a: "One Country, One Set of Laws!"
