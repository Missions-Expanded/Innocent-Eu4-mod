 ANS_a_magraves_ambition_title: "A Magrave's Ambition"
 ANS_a_magraves_ambition_desc: "Albrecht Achilles the Third is certainly one of the most militant rulers the Hohenzollern Ansbach has seen. With ambitions to have Franconia under his belt, he got into a dispute with the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg, which lead to the first Margrave War, causing much devastation in Franconia, and marking one of the first wars that encompassed much of the Franconia we know today."
 ANS_duke_of_franconia_title: "Duke of Franconia"
 ANS_duke_of_franconia_desc: "The ultimate goal of Albrecht was to acquire the title of the Duke of Franconia. The title was nothing but titular and has been held so far mostly by the Bishops of Würzburg. Now, while Albrecht was not quite successful, that doesn't meant that the task is all but hopeless."
 ANS_free_cities_title: "Enforce Submission"
 ANS_free_cities_desc: "The ambitions of Albrecht were quelled quickly due to the involvement of the Imperial Free City of Nuremberg, which refused to submit. If we are to be the true dukes of Franconia and its representatives, we must bring the cities under our control."
 ANS_finish_the_church_title: "Finish the Johanneskirche"
 ANS_finish_the_church_desc: "The Johanneskirche in Ansbach has been in use for many years, but there still are many parts that are yet to be finished. It is imperative we take the matters into our trusty hands, and let the project be finally finished."
 ANS_margraves_palace_title: "Margrave's Palace"
 ANS_margraves_palace_desc: "Some of the previous rulers that were the suzerains of Ansbach have expanded the Stiftshof into a water castle, but this simple building will not be enough to glorify the dynasty of Ansbach. It's high time we fund a building to praise the achievements of the Franconian Hohenzollerns."
 ANS_Ansbach_porcelain_title: "Ansbach Porcelain"
 ANS_Ansbach_porcelain_desc: "Not so long after Johann Friedrich Böttger finally discovered the secret of producing porcelain, many porcelain manufactories sprung up across Europe, the most prominent among them being the Meissner porcelain manufactories. If we appeal to the Saxons, we may be able to exploit this knowledge and create manufactories of our own."

 ME_Ansbach_Events.1.t: "First Margrave War"
 ME_Ansbach_Events.1.d: "The First Margrave War was a conflict sparked by the ambitions of Albrecht Achilles, the ruler of Hohenzollern Ansbach. The main point of conflict was the city of Nuremberg, whose burgraves once were of the Hohenzollern dynasty. Due to this, the ambitious margrave wished to restore the control of the city, but to no avail."
 ME_Ansbach_Events.1.a: "The Hohenzollerns shall be restored!"
 ME_Ansbach_Events.1.b: "We must await an opportunity."
